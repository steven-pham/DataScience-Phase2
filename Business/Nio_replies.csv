"You just need a thriving and growing market, plenty of auto manufacturers are successful and they only appeal to ridiculous luxury and niche markets. Certainly not strong on the global aspect, but they profit and that‚Äôs what matters. You could have 90% of the global market but if you‚Äôre not profitable, you‚Äôre not profitable. 

Tesla could also pick up a lot more market share by doing something such as making a more entry level car that average consumer could afford, whether it‚Äôs the states, Europe, or Asia.

"I have a number of 20c 1/15/2021 calls, along with stock and a variety of short-term stock positions between 21-23.

Obviously, it's speculation to assume what the price would be.   However, they've been delivering nothing but good news (and record breaking car numbers).   There's better DD in here and you should research a bit yourself to get a vibe for whether it's a worthwhile investment and how much you're willing to risk.

That said, their December production numbers and quarterly report should be released on 1/4/2021 and NIO day should be toward end of December.   I'm planning on holding the calls toward end of expiration depending on how they're performing.    Compared to other EV performance, I believe they could hit 30-35 per share by that point.

Keep in mind that there's some risk in production challenges, expansion and cash flow, etc.  And while they are producing more cars every month, they still need to have the market share to sell those cars.    This all looks good now, but my recommendation would be to monitor the stock and have a strategy on when to exit if things start looking rocky - I have faith that NIO will prevail across the board in the long run, but you'll need to be unattached enough to be willing to sell the shares if there are significant drops and re-enter on recovery.

On the other side of this, if NIO does soar consider at what point you're willing to take some profit and plan your strategy - as the price increases, it'll be pushing ATH and those may not always be sustainable short-term.   I'll likely sell some of my position if they hit 23-25 to cover cost of investment.

If you're holding shares, just keep them forever.   I like the concept of taking half the profits made and convert into shares that don't evaporate quickly, but you'll know your risk tolerance and appetite better.   Good luck.",3.0,2020-09-18 15:26:24,6.0

"If Biden wins, I believe the stock price will follow the overall market and dip. Afterwards, it will rocket as he start to introduce green energy policies and people start to think of NIO expanding to the US as he's certainly more lax and agreeable towards China than Trump. 

If Trump wins, NIO's expansion to US will definitely be delayed until after 2024. The stock will still go up in the long run with expansion to Europe in sights albeit not as fast as it would in the first scenario.

"One of the things I love about NIOs battery as a service is that they can swap batteries with better and newer technology to reduce cost over time.    They likely will still charge the BaaS fee, since customers can swap fully charged batteries in 3 minutes without having to recharge, but their operating cost will go down.   Allowing more battery swap station expansions. 
Any EV technology will benefit NIO in the long run.    Short term investors may cause a dip without understanding.the potential, but I wouldn't be too concerned unless you're holding short term options.

"BaaS.  Consumers won't be tied to their batteries in the same way they are if purchase price includes a battery and ties you to that battery's lifecycle.  I think BaaS is primarily about dealing with the lack of private parking infra in Chinese residences - often hi rises, little control over which space to park in etc, versus in the US where people tend to have a private garage or parking spot.  But even in the US, BaaS is compelling especially for people that live in outdoor parking apartment complexes w/o dedicated power.",3.0,2020-09-16 10:55:44,15.0

>If you own shares of a stock that gets delisted, **nothing really changes**. You still have your ownership share in the company, but the means of trading your shares and the value of your shares could be drastically different.  
>  
>Delisting comes with a scarlet letter. Most stocks get delisted because their share prices have fallen to less than $1 and they no longer meet exchange listing requirements. These companies are generally considered either failed, speculative or unviable altogether. That means they'd typically draw little interest from the investing public. You could potentially trade shares in the less regulated OTC market, however, so there is still an outlet if you wish to buy or sell.  
>  
>**A company like Alibaba, however, isn't your typical delisted stock. If it's removed from the U.S. exchanges, there's little doubt that the market for shares drops considerably and the value probably falls significantly.** These companies would probably just list their shares on a different exchanges.

Delisting isn't going to change the company's fundamentals. If the company is doing good, it will continue to do good. Also, delisting isn't going to happen overnight. There will be news. For short/mid term investors, the price drop will hurt, but for long term investors, it's nothing more than noise.

"Due to delta hedging, the sellers of the call options have to buy sufficient stock to remain delta neutral. If there is a lot of open interest (OI)  at a strike and time is short, within 3 days of expiration, the time premium on these options eroded away, faster and faster. As a result, these option holders will likely start to sell their calls, which then means the market maker that held stock against those calls will then sell that stock. When the options volume is high, this has a pronounced effect as resistance.

in my personal view, to do in-depth research on Nio, the first thing to do is filter out the anti-China bias, and just focus on the company and it's prospects. based on my preliminary research before i invested, I'd say there are 70% positive reviews and 30% neutral to negative reviews, with a margin of error of 5%. if you look from historical perspective, reviews were less positive in 2015-2017, a bit of skepticism, but the momentum shifted from 2018 onwards. 

started seeing more of these cars on the road after 2018, so i think prospects are good, I've been to China several times in the past few years for internships, in the past I've barely seen any in 2014 to 2017, now there's a lot more. and there are rebates buying these cars there due to being eco-friendly. anyway, this is just based on personal experience, not investment advice.",12.0,2020-09-10 03:45:26,36.0

Just answering why it‚Äôs down... It‚Äôs been going down since the crash last week so give it some time to consolidate this week or two. I would use this opportunity to pick up low stock prices and sell off when it hits to 19-20, which I have the confidence that it will reach that peak again. I wouldn‚Äôt be worried if NIO drops to $10 because it had a good track record of jumping back to high 20s with lots of future plans ahead of NIO. Patience is what kills me lol


Overall, NIO is fits best for a long-term investment. Buy lots of low, sell high on the way. Unless you have thousands to buy/sell on the same day with a 50cents gain, then sure it‚Äôs understandable. Just be wary of US presidential election on Nov.3, TUES.

"Technically you would still own the shares. I think they‚Äôd be held by your broker or they would send some certificates to you. You‚Äôd have to sell them offline, so to speak. In the old days, for small companies that didn‚Äôt qualify to be on an exchange, brokers would call each other up and sell shares that way. I‚Äôd imagine it would be something similar. I could be wrong, though.

A share is a slice of ownership in the company. The exchange just makes it easier to buy and sell those shares. Delisting just means the exchange won‚Äôt let those shares be traded there, the same way a shopping mall could ban McDonalds from doing business in their mall. But it doesn‚Äôt affect McDonalds per se. People that like McDonalds just need to go elsewhere to buy their stuff.

"So many things can happen, no one knows exactly what and why, and when. I think you should remember that the market is a combination of big institutional investors and many smaller fish who undergo large emotional mood swings. FOMO and greed are dominating our investor psychology and these emotions combined with the many risks, opportunities and uncertainties of the future, create sometimes strong volatility.  

Long story short: it can go up and it can go down. It can be a bloodbath or a party for invested capital. It can also move sideways. 

A couple things are at play right now in relation to Nio: we have a global pandemic, Tesla has had a large run up, new EV manufacturers (from China) are entering the market, Chinese stocks might become delisted from Nasdaq, Nio is coming to Europe, Nio is doing great on paper, Nio is giving out new shares and creates (small) dilution for current investors, Tesla wasn't included in S&P 500, the Nasdaq is currently going down (correction or beat down?)...

New head of autonomous driving department is just getting settled in his new position as we speak AND the latest share offering of over 100m shares, together with the recent funding will ensure NIO has the liquidity to push forward with increasing production capacity for all three models. Furthermore, they're going to pedal-to-the-metal on their R&D and autonomous driving as well as getting ready the upcoming sedan, all of this while eyeing the European market.

It's been a risky bet for NIO, but the orchestration of this plan is quite brilliant and it's very satisfying to see all of these moving parts coming together to solidify this company's baseline.

An enticing story based on a visionary mission (albeit following through Tesla's comet tail to some extent), which is now backed up by their balance sheet.

"I believe competition will drive up innovation considerably, especially in such a strong EV market as China. That being said, Nio is pretty well positioned at this moment due to a handful of different factors, such as strong branding, good quality of their cars (luxury EV SUVs), their entire lifestyle ecosystem, their balance sheet and ofc BaaS service, among others.

My guess is they won't have an easy roadmap to establishing themselves as the lead EV car manufacturer in China, but they have definitely set themselves up nicely for this challenge. Looking back, a lot of positive things happened in a pretty short amount of time, even with the covid19 backdrop looming over everyone's head. That's saying something.

As usual, anything can happen... However, by the current looks of it - Nio is definitely a strong bet for the future (considerably more so, even compared with a few months ago).",6.0,2020-09-03 20:26:36,66.0

"I agree with most of your analysis on this. Really well thought out. My only addition is the challenge I see with scale. Not so much operationally, but in penetrating the large Chinese consumer market.

Aside from great engineering, Tesla‚Äôs secret sauce continues to be their zero dollars spent on advertising. For most companies that is one of their largest expense categories. NIO is no different.

NIO has a strong brand and have done well cultivating a customer base that‚Äôs invested in their cars; that said, it‚Äôs been expensive. I‚Äôm interested to see how they get from 4,000 deliveries to 10,000 deliveries per month and how they manage the marketing costs associated.",2.0,2020-09-03 23:49:56,66.0

"You can just have a look at the smartphone industry in the past 10 years, where we had Apple as a spearhead innovator gaining huge market share in the first years of the smartphone boom.

There are a few Chinese companies whose market penetration strategy has been to either come up with extremely affordable devices (OnePlus) OR shoot for those high-spec, not-so-affordable devices (Huawei). Once established, they of course made changes to their marketing mix, in terms of product positioning, pricing, etc.

We are already seeing highly affordable EVs on the Chinese market, however they do not cater to the medium-high earning class in China: the people who can afford to commute AND travel using an EV (thus playing into China's electrical transformation narrative). It's clear that there is ample space for Nio to unravel their strategy of pushing luxury cars first, followed up by family-oriented vehicles in the upcoming years.

Just have in mind that this is a company with a good balance sheet, who knows how to take advantage of their position and who is thoughtful with its next steps. This is something that will come to true fruition in the next 5-7 years, the hype you are seeing now is what Tesla benefitted from a few years back.

"That's a very good point. We all know that Tesla has been and still is, to a large extent, the spearhead of this large transformation within the transport industry. This alone has contributed vastly to their global reach, besides Elon having an innate understanding of memetics as well as his excellent ability to inspire and mobilize people around his ideas (thinking about it now, this might have been the catalyst behind most of his decisions over the past decade in regards to Tesla). 

Having said this, Tesla's status did not come cheap, as the hefty price has been translated into years and years of non-profitability. It was a high-risk, high-payoff situation, and we've all seen the results of this bet this year.

Nio does not have the same opportunity Tesla had, so the financing for 'being on people's minds' has to come from somewhere else. Which is why I suspect they came up with the entire lifestyle ecosystem which is meant to capture people's imagination and stir discussions in the same way as Tesla's 'imagine this electric future' topic did. 

While a different lifestyle where Nio is taking care of part of your daily concerns is not as exciting as revolutionizing the world transportation, it's still a decent hook, for which Nio must pay one way or another. As we've seen, they chose a path with earlier profitability (or at least aiming for it), while having to fund for it.

I think the positioning of their upcoming sedan model will translate their strategy of reaching the 10,000 deliveries and will offer more insight into their moves and marketing strategy. The EC6 model is definitely a good base, as an affordable, solid Model Y competitor and my guess is that it will extend their mind reach over the next 6-12 months.",3.0,2020-09-04 00:08:48,66.0

"It definitely a great buy. Cheap, with potential.

I feel like there's a lot of unnecessary distrust towards the company just because it's Chinese. If this was an American company, I am pretty sure the price would be in the one hundreds now. 

Other than making all the right moves, NIO cars look and work awesome and their CEO have great ambition as well as passion. NIO also calls themselves a mobility company rather than an EV company. This means that in the future, they could move onto other forms of transport. How is this not a massive plus? Imagine in the future having NIO airplanes with NOMI. The potential is endless and I just hope that NIO is able to fulfil their potential.

One thing I fear, however, is that Tesla would be able to come up with a million mile battery. NIO CEO mentioned that the company came up with the idea of battery swapping due to the poor advancement in battery technology as compared to technology in general. You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nJ7-s8IZPc). So if Tesla is able to deliver on that promise, NIO's BaaS will be rendered redundant. And if the general consensus is that a million mile battery is compulsory, Tesla can drive up the cost of the battery and this lead to both lower profit margins for their competitors and more expensive EVs other than Tesla's own. Both scenarios which are bearish for NIO.",6.0,2020-09-03 04:20:04,75.0

I find with the market in general there are always more reasons not to be invested than to be.... global politics, the price is too high, growing competition, pandemic, etc.  Long term, I think NIO is the most credible pure EV challenger to Tesla, and it's the home team in a huge and growing marketplace with a government policy of 25% electric in just a few years.  Short term it can absolutely go down, but it also might not.  I think in a year or so it's fairly likely to have crossed $40.

Basicly it means that if NIO stock price will rise above this striking price this guy will make lots of money (the higher above the better)
If it falls below he will lose lots of money, and for every day passes while he doesnt sell he also lose some money.

NIO is a great company but lately expectations by shareholders on this subreddit are being driven out of hand, and that is partly due to the greatness of Tesla over the past little bit (which by the way, is also an excellent company to be long in).

&#x200B;

NIO currently has a market-cap of 22B and is roughly $19/share. At $60 a share, NIO would have a market-cap of over 66B, which would place it in the upper echelon of car manufacturers. I believe that is an attainable number in 2 years time.

&#x200B;

I would love to be wrong and I would love for my NIO shares to be $150+ in 24 months, but I don't see it happening in 2 years.

&#x200B;

Bullish Scenario (2 year outlook) - Europe expansion under way, robo-taxi ready to hit the market, BAAS taking off exponentially - $100-110 price per share.

&#x200B;

Modest/ most likely scenario (2 year outlook) - Europe expansion confirmed but still in the building/planning stages, robo-taxi showing promise but not ready for the markets, BAAS taking off exponentially - $60 price per share.

According to a friend in China: When he attended the opening of the 150th NIO House, the people in-charged said the backorder for NIO EV is at record levels. This means, NIO delivery for August = maximum production. At minimum, it should par with July delivery. Best case, it'll break 4000. Bullish.

Based on [this](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-announces-us235-million-private-placements-short), 235 million will be changed into NIO shares at $3.5 or lower. Using simple maths, that'd be another 67 million shares dilution on Sept 5th. This can lead to about 5% drop in price on Monday Sept 7th or later. Bearish.

\---

If NIO releases Aug delivery next week, we can expect a price spike, followed by a price down next Monday. Going to be a roller-coaster ride.

If NIO release Aug delivery the week after, it'll mostly end up as a pre-market pump, followed by a dump at market open. Assuming panic selling, price may crash badly.

Sell ITM Puts.

\----

Example:

Instead of buying NIO at the current price of $18.50, 

Sell Put, Strike $20, Expiry 9/11 ; 100 shares per option.

The premium should be around $2.5 on Monday assuming no drastic price change. Although you will be paying $20 per share, but considering you get $2.5/share from the option premium, the overall cost is lower than buying shares directly.

What if NIO price is above $20 on 9/11? You get to keep the premium as profit. pretty much a win-win situation.

You can also adjust the strike price depending on your desire to own the shares. 

* Strikes at $19 or $18 has a lower chance to stay ITM, but gives you a much better price if assigned.
* Strikes above $20, higher chance to get the shares, but less cost reduction.

\----

How to use:

When you think NIO reaches its lowest point. Sell put at that time. This will let you own shares at an even lower price assuming the option expires in the money. 

If price rocket upwards, you make money... which isn't bad. Keep selling puts until you get assigned.

If price goes down further... well, you are bullish on NIO long term, just didn't get it at the lowest point. No biggie.",1.0,2020-08-31 11:02:04,101.0
"Tesla is omni-directionally integrated. Their business model is very strong and able to profit from almost everything related to their EV. From manufacturing to selling, even software, insurance and maintenance. However, to get to where it is today takes time. Tesla has IPO over a decade. 

NIO, on the other hand, acts like a string, connecting up all the individual dots to create something great. JAC is the first, for manufacturing cars. They then partner with Sunning for better exposure of NIO Space. They also join forces with CATL for BaaS. They even collaborate with Intel/MobilEye for autonomous driving.

From a general perspective, NIO is losing profitability with each new partner. JAC takes a cut from manufacturing; For BaaS, NIO only retains 25%. Don't know the details for Sunning and MobilEye... but I don't think they're going be free. However, looking from another perspective, if NIO does things all by itself - like Tesla, it'll most probably not be where it is today.

This is the difference in Business Model of the two companies, which is also the reason why NIO can expand that rapidly.

A lot of times the short term investors are not too happy with secondary offerings. That's all I can say.

There really is no reason to panic though. If you believed in this company before this offering was announced, then your belief in them should be even higher now solely due to the fact that they're about to add an extra 1B cash reserve.

"It's mostly speculation until it is confirmed. It can either be confirmed by the company itself, or by a source that has correspondence with the company.

Sometimes a company will announce a secondary offering but it won't actually take place until several days later. For example, Virgin Galactic announced a secondary offering during their last quarterly reports, just about 3.5 weeks ago. The price of the stock was around $23-$24 at the time. However, the offering itself didn't actually take place until a week later. The stock tanked a bit, but they were able to successfully close the secondary offering at $19.50 per share.

&#x200B;

I would like to believe in NIO's case that the secondary offering was indeed at $20.44, but we can't say for sure yet. A lot of the times, an investment firm or group of wealthy individuals reach out to a company and offer to buy X number of shares at X price, which can lead to secondary offerings. Thus, the offering price could be well decided before it is announced.

"Depends on your direction, you want to sit long (2-5 years) and make more return or day trade short term and then hold, or just maxmise profit in short term.

I'd suggest you look into shorting and/or calling with your shares. Learn more on that before attempting.

Selling and buying in again has its risk, if you're not careful at looking the gerneral market and it rides up too fast, you will be out of shares and waiting again.

If you're looking to buy in and then hopefully sell at some higher value, then buying ASAP is the way to go. Maybe it'll dip, maybe it won't. No one can say for sure.

The idea there is that you believe that price will trend upwards over some arbitrary timespan, so you buy in and hold until that time. Daily minor fluctuations that might happen tomorrow all wash out.

I bought in at an average around $3.50. Now that it's $17, that one time it dropped 20% in one day doesn't really matter anymore, right?

And just to reiterate, you can get lucky timing the market and sell at $17 and then buy again at $15, but at that point you're trying to guess what the market is going to do and there's thousands of people who infinitely smarter with ungodly resources who still can't get it right, so keep that in mind.

People just need to hear that is takes 3 mins.. its a major selling piece even if not 100% required. Going for a 3min battery swap if you van charge at home is still very annoying. There is a reason that 95% of Teslas charge at home.. its sooo much better.,1.0,2020-08-25 10:00:43,134.0
"Battery swapping is a good idea i think. Owners have the chance to upgrade their build as battery tech improves. Think of it as upgrading your PC parts for better ones. Owners don't have to buy a new car to access better battery tech. Owners also have the freedom to pick a more cost effective choice if they only drive short distances or swap for a long distance battery for a couple days, for example road trips, vacations etc. Also if somehow the battery cell gets damaged or dies, you can just swap it. With Tesla, you're stuck with the same battery so you would have to buy a new car. Even if they could repair it the process could take a weeks. I also heard that if your Tesla gets wrecked, it's near impossible to go and get parts to repair your vehicle.",2.0,2020-08-24 11:22:36,134.0
"It's good if you only use it for quick replacement on long trips. Perfect for that, 3 minutes and boom you got another 400KM.

But from a business model perspective I'm concerned that it can become a very expensive model, imagine trying to estimate how many fresh batteries you need to have in a station.

"Don't get me wrong. I'm.actually bullish and shareholder of NIO. Is just that this BaaS model is extremely risky in my opinion. I'm glad that I'm usually wrong in my forecasts.

I do give them a point because if BaaS is successful then NIO is locking in a stream of revenue, it's like ""selling"" the battery for a long time and the price of battery swap can be adjusted as they please, not like simply selling the battery today and not seeing a penny in future years. For that reason I think this could be a genius idea.

My problem is that batteries are the most expensive part of EV and simply having them sitting in stations hoping for possible clients to come and use them is very capital intensive. I don't agree that much will the analogy of a gas station, because NIO battery replacement only works for NIO cars. Gas stations can serve any car.

"**PROS:**

* Trump's Anti-China sentiment is only pushing Chinese consumers towards Made in China products (If you check the numbers, Tesla's Model 3 dropped from July by about 3,000 than June's numbers)
* NIO production is increasing by 25% by Q4 after a tweak to production chain in Q3
* If you read the recent earnings call, the CEO says even his friends can't get an ES8 delivered early so demand is pent up
* NIO is getting the NEV credits that they can re-sell in Q4 to add to their gross margin
* BaaS allows NIO to sell their cars at a much more reasonable price compared to similar-spec EVs at a way better price point (with the economy being in tatters, consumers are only going to flock to NIO due to the bang for buck for what u get)

**CONS:**

* the NIO CEO acknowledged that their Navigation-on-Pilot was not as advanced as Tesla's.. but I mean if you are selling at 10-25% less than your competitor, that's expected

" `How is tweaking production related to Trump's anti-China rhetoric?` 

It is not and I never said that it was. Read again.

`Are you saying the Trump administration does not have an anti-China policy right now?` 

No, I'm not. I'm saying that it's not what explains the drop.

You claim the drop is due to Trump anti-China policy but Trump is going after China since he got in office. That's part of how he got elected, feeding the racist part of USA with the idea of a new enemy to fight after the russian and the Islam terrorist.

It hasn't impacted Tesla sales in China in the slightest considering the relationship that has been built between Tesla & the chinese government.

Again as I said, the 3k drop is less than a week production from Giga Shangai, that's due to production lines upgrade plus refilling the inventory in shops etc.

Also the biggest policy that could have an impact *in your theory* is a week old or so, it couldn't have impact July sales numbers.

`Do you think Chinese consumers are blindly just buying Tesla products? People buy their own products.. that's common in every country.` 

Tesla demand is sky high everywhere in the world & isn't impacted by the retard's policy. 

People buying Tesla are more wealthy ones (considering the price tag), likely more educated and to have the ability to see the difference between the US government idiots & Elon/Tesla.

Also cars sold by Tesla in China are Made in China so they aren't considered as USAn like you think by the population/government.

"Short selling refers to those who borrow stock and aim to capitalize off of falling stock prices. They aim to borrow shares, sell those shares at a given rate and then buy the shares back to return to the lender. The money made is from selling high/buying low. 
  
Someone who bought shares of Nio at $8 or less a few months ago and sold in the past week at $14 or $15 wouldn‚Äôt be a short seller. Any profits taken from such sales would fall under short term capital gains (assuming, again, that they have held the stock for months as opposed to years). 
  
Both groups have likely contributed to recent changes in stock price. Not everyone is going to hold long in anticipation of greater gains and lower tax rates. Some are happy to sell and take gains as a stock is pricing/correcting rather than risk a further drop. That‚Äôs especially true when there are many who bought into Nio at <$10 a share. Doesn‚Äôt mean some of them won‚Äôt buy back in.
  
There‚Äôs a lot that goes into it, but earnings periods can seem counter-intuitive because there are different kinds of shareholders with different mentalities/strategies/goals, which means good news doesn‚Äôt always result in immediate, sustainable increase in stock price. Likewise, bad news doesn‚Äôt always result in the opposite. Give it time. Good news on deliveries, BaaS developments, etc could all factor into further adjustments in stock price over the next month or two. People circle earnings like vultures, and you can make a lot of money that way. But it‚Äôs also possible to capitalize on all of the action in between. And if you‚Äôre long on the stock, understand that these periods of volatility will happen, especially with a young, growing company like Nio. It can be hard not to obsess about near term stock volatility (especially of the negative variety) when you anticipate long-term growth, but there‚Äôs really no reason to panic.",6.0,2020-08-14 05:52:35,163.0

Could I ask if short-sellers are using CFDs or are doing actual borrowing and short-selling? I believe CFDs have financial costs per annum (at least that's why my broker does).

"Same thing happened after Tesla's Q2 ER. That one qualified them for being included into the S&P 500, so normally it would have mooned but instead it tanked. This is people taking profits while they can.

Nio isn't falling back to mid single digits again like people expect. The company is simply too strong now. As I stated in a previous post, and I've seen a lot of similar sentiment, this company would have a MUCH higher valuation if it were a US company.

Let's also not ignore the Trump Admin submitting new recommendations to the SEC to delist Chinese stocks that are not adhering to GAAP standards for financial audits with companies listed on US exchanges. One side of me understands, as Nio doesn't submit their financials to SEC for audits, so we don't REALLY know if these reports are accurate. Thank Luckin Coffee for that speculation. Personally, I think it'd be a lot easier to fake a coffee company than an EV manufacturer.

The opposite side is that we, US shareholders, have our investments threatened. We can always gain access to the stock via other exchange platforms, but moving our assets like that around is nauseating to green investors. Major institutions will find their way as they always have. That panic sell, and I'm guessing that some of the deterioration we see today is related to this news, will cause the stock to tank.

Long haul, this is a solid company. Reviews on the vehicles are surprisingly positive. They made their presence known in the world of super cars and succeeded incredibly. But to compare Nio to Tesla, NKLA, is a bit of a misdirection. Tesla is an energy company that happens to make cars. NKLA has barely broken ground, literally, on their factory in Coolidge AZ. Nio is manufacturing EVs and selling them with a growing demand and excelling business. China WANTS and NEEDS EVs, not just to make a better product but to also drastically cut down on their smog pollution that hangs over cities like Beijing, a shroud of illness and death not just for people, but their environment at large. They KNOW without EVs, that situation will get worse.

I believe the race to sell vehicles isn't for market dominance of vehicles, but for batteries. Tesla's weak point is that you have to charge your vehicle. Long drives aren't fun when you have to wait 40+ minutes at a recharge station. This limits the general range of the unit, and more importantly, the customer. 

Battery swap tech completely changes the game. It's next gen gas stations. I liken a battery swap station end goal to the USB port. If the leading EV manufacturer can establish battery swap dominance, would the next step not make more sense to establish a standardized battery make for all EVs? Sure, you may lose some steam on vehicle sales as it gives customers more options, but if you reach a standardized battery swap tech for the industry, well that's a muuuuch bigger fish to land. License out the batteries that get swapped to other EVs and suddenly, not only do you have your own EV company, you create a new kind of energy company.

"I'll be 32 in a few months and started about 3 years ago. So not really a bunch of experience, but I do feel I have a MUCH better understanding on how the economy really functions, and of course, we'll never know enough, so stay hungry for knowledge. Based on what you've stated for your Nio holds, you're in a MUCH better position than I am. I started in with an average of like $3.70s, so good on your for getting in lower and holding through. Sorry to hear about the medical bills, it sucks selling at that point and kicking yourself as you watch it absolutely soar into the heavens. I bought a handful of SHOP shares back when they were like $95 and panic sold, so I'm familiar with the feeling of what could have been.

Lessons in my brief time?

\#1 - Be. Patient. Don't let the autists at r/wallstreetbets trick you into hype. Hype is always good and needed, but the hunger to strut their gains the way they show, that just likely won't be you, or me, or much of anyone. \~80% of options expire at a loss. All the fake internet points in the world will not help you pay your electric bill.

\#2 - READ - It is in your best interest to read and consume materials related to the economy. CNBC is my go to for financial NEWS, not investing advice. Big difference there. I also work for a bank, but not in the investing branch. Still, I was able to sign up for our daily and weekly new letters that come out that touch on the macro US economic news of the day. I have a lot of trust in what those newsletters say, as they have proven VERY reliable. Still, it's good to look at other reliable sources. Reuters is a good reference too. Overall, company news gets covered pretty well on the bigger sites. And they always have links to other articles to at other sources. CNBC just happens to be my portal. Books are good too! Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad Poor Dad is a must read imo. It isn't without it's criticism, but it gets you thinking differently about money. Dave Ramsey is good too. And Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People is an absolute must as well just for life in general. Documentaries are great too! Personal favorite is The Men Who Built America. It's pretty dramatized but lays out how the original monopolies began to run amok at the turn of the century. But they did it because they could foresee how their products would shape the world. It takes a lot to look that far ahead. Super fascinating if you look at it from that perspective. Amazon streams it i think?

\#3 - When wanting to invest in something, look at sectors first. Understand who the big players are and WHY they're big players. My mistake was that I invested too early without better DD. Now my DD is relatively better, but its taken a while to understand. Use ETFs for sector investments, but if you think you've got a good buy, buy the individual stock. EVs are a symptom of the Green Revolution that is coming. It will take decades to play out, but EVs are a good place to start. Think of it like if EVs work for consumers, what's next for commercial? A hard question. Can you see planes running just on electric? What happens if one is hit by lightning in the air? Or the massive shipping barges all over the world? Cruise ships? Solutions for those are decades away, but coming nonetheless. The world will inevitably exhaust its fossil fuels at some point. And with an ever expanding population like China, all that smog and pollution will be too much for people to tolerate. Hence why there is such a push for EV industry in the region. 

\#4 - Employer sponsored 401ks and IRAs are good! I have them. But an additional retirement account outside of the employer match... ehhhh doesn't really jive with me. My work matches me at 6% and I'm putting away 7.25% too. I know a lot of people keep their stuff in retirement accounts, but I have a different opinion on those entirely, especially if you're doing regular trading quite frequently. I'm a long term holder so I'm still buying, generally not selling.

And also it's a chinese company, so I understand if investor sentiment is a bit wary coming into earnings. I don't think it's priced it because the previous jump from 11ish was due to the delivery numbers for July, and today spike is probably somehow related to the stimulus measures passed by Trump.

I am hoping the price sinks pre-earnings at least below $14. I avg'd around $11 but I wanna get in before earnings.

"Shorts and Put buyers are usually short term traders, looking for profit. They expect the price to drop, so they ""enter"" with a short instead of a ""buy""

Using Tesla for example, since it's the most shorted stock. When Tesla reached near 900 in Feb, these people think it's over valued, so they short; The easily bagged 150 per share as TSLA drop to 750.

Then Tesla hit 800 again, short, make gains again... this continue until late June... when they short, but prices keep climbing... it hit their stop-loss, which the shorts have to ""Buy"" back to cover... this causes the price to shoot even higher.

Although you see shorts getting killed, but they actually make lots of profit. As the saying goes: ""Prices take the stairs up, but jump out of the window when going down""

\---- 

For APPL. Those people think that Apple went up 10% after earnings, price seems too high, so they short or buy puts.

NIO, no different. Price was already up 10% last Monday. They concluded that a good earnings is  already priced-in, so price should drop, short... I think they likely didn't do their homework, as last Monday's spike was due to excellent delivery for July.",2.0,2020-08-09 14:03:19,201.0

The ONLY weapon they have to keep the NIO Stock from rising is to short more stock. A bit like a Cocaine Addict whose only solution is to have another shot. What happens when Item 1 goes close to ZERO. New Shorts do NOT want to short NIO. Then you will get an imbalance of Buying versus Selling and the Stock may be explosive on the upside. When Stock goes UP, then Short Sellers get daily margin calls. If they do not meet those margins calls they are bought out of their position.

"No your sale had nothing to with Short selling. You owned the stock & you sold. To give you example of Short Selling.
On Friday there were 41.0 Million Shares being sold by people who had shares to sell. IN ADDITION there was 16.7 million Shares Sold Short. These people arranged to BORROW shares & then sell them.
So 41.0 plus 16.7 equals total volume of 57.7 million
So basically 29% of total volume was people who sold shares they did not have but borrowed. Those SHORTS probably total at least 127 million as last reported with latest numbers coming out this Wednesday. Those Shorts are losing a lot of money. They are doing their best to make the stock look bad daily, as that is in their interest, so that is does not go up. IF Q2 earnings are good, even if some of these Shorts start to cover & other lose their appetitie to short more THEN the stock is potentially explosive on the upside. Of course the Shorts will do everything in their power to make that not happen. Remember the NIO Shorts just like the Bullion Gold Shorts who have gotten killed are typically a lot better funded than the retail NIO long shareholders. It is just that sometimes they get thing horribly wrong. In Q! when NIO was having trouble meeting payroll & the stock was $2 these NIO Shorts were probably licking their lips looking at bankruptcy.

"It's not that difficult if you think about it from the big money's point of view. It IS stock manipulation, but it's within the ""acceptable behavior"".

\--- 

Ignore your own portfolio, instead think of trading 10 million shares of NIO. That's over 130 million, huge sum for a retail investor, but not much in the eyes of the big money. 

Anyway, back on topic... let's say you want to buy 10 million shares of NIO. How will you do it?

\---

If you try to buy 10 million shares like you would do 10 shares, you'll face a problem: There isn't enough people out there that are currently selling their shares. Huge demand, low supply = price rise.  

You can get 10 million shares, but at that time, NIO price will be very much higher, and the average price per share you get becomes way above the current market number.

If you think NIO at 14 is value buy, but due to what you did, you end up with NIO at an average price of 17. This effectively means you lost 30 million (10m shares, $3 price difference) before the game even begins.

\---  

You can also put a limit buy... let's say, buy only when price is below X... This sounds good in theory, but due to the large volume, you've effectively created a support level.

When other traders see a huge buy order, will they sell their shares? Obviously not. If some big money thinks NIO will go up, why not hitch a ride... In fact, it will lure more buyers in, placing their stop loss at your buy price.

End result, you don't get to buy many.

\--- 

So, what will you do?

First, you enter by buying all available shares up to the max your acceptable level.

Then, you set a ""resistance"" to prevent prices from rising, then start buying at a lower price. This effectively creates a price channel where you control both top and bottom.

Whenever price rises, you put out a huge sell order. Buyers who see that will be deterred, since they can't break the resistance = they can't profit = they'll sell = price drop. Other stock holders, sees that the price is not going anywhere, so they sell too. 

You scope up all these reduced-price shares. After collecting enough, you move on.

If you know TA, this is reflected as the consolidation phase, where there's little price movement for a period of time, before something big happens.

\---

Why is this type of stock manipulation acceptable?

Because, the by-product of these actions is stability. If the big money can only buy/sell in large quantities, stock prices will be all over the place. 

Today, someone buy 10m shares, price goes up to 20. Tomorrow, another sell and price crash to 10. Will you even want to participate in this type of market? 

\---

Also, this type of manipulation are very temporary.

Look at this other angle: While collecting shares, NIO releases more good news. This lures another, or many other big money. 

Remember how we talked about the lack of shares in the beginning? Well, these newcomers face the same problem, but to their benefit, there's someone selling to make a resistance, so they'll happily gobble up all these ""Sell"".

This means the manipulator also has risk. They need to be wary of other big money. To minimize risk, they'll only raise resistance when necessary (price rising).

Delisting would hurt everyone‚Äôs bottom line, and those institutions have strong lobbying power. Second, delisting Chinese companies would greatly impact the world-class standing the NYSE enjoys today. New York is the financial capital of the world, delisting would damage that reputation and make New York second fiddle to the likes of London or Hong Kong. That would hit Trump personally. Last, delisting would honestly hurt America more than it would hurt China. Chinese companies would just list on other international exchanges and keep on truckin‚Äô on. Probably wouldn‚Äôt even bat an eye. Meanwhile, there would be more severe financial implications for stateside exchanges and investors. On a final note, everyone brings up Luckin Coffee and the lack of oversight, but cooked books happen everywhere, even with oversight. Remember Enron?

Compare the PE ratios for Chinese and American companies in similar industries  and you‚Äôll see much more appropriate PE ratios for the Chinese companies. In the end, do your own research into any company you invest in, Chinese, American, or otherwise. Make smart choices, but remember, fortune favors the bold.

"I am just a retired individual investor. I have recently bought NIO & am also looking at TSLA. Just the sharp reduction in EV Battery Costs per Kwh suggests to me that renting for a year & then checking prices is a no brainer decision that is likely to be preferred by customers if offered to them.

Also if you cannot afford a 100 kwh battery then you can rent a 70 kwh battery & hope the 100 kwh falls in price in a year. Perhaps even wait for a 120kwh or higher capacity battery. Also if you can buy the EV & rent the battery your initial costs may substantially lower your initial investment suggesting that at least for the Chinese market the Battery Swapping Model may ultimately dominate. 

In USA & Europe the existing Car Dealer infrastructure offers a potential for Nationwide Battery Swapping centers & would give Auto Makers a chance to hit back on TSLA. For example Ford starts to selll NIO EV Vehicles plus their own EVs & introduces Battery Swapping at their dealerships. I wonder if the NIO 1200 EV Battery Patents also cover Battery Swapping as currently used by NIO  So overall I think the market will move to Battery Swapping which may be a business model risk not yet fully appreciated in the TSLA Market Cap.",3.0,2020-07-28 11:44:27,257.0

If NIO can manage to implement their Chinese experience to the EU and US, selling high quality luxury experience  as opposed to Tesla ‚Äòs cool high-tech vibe, they can have a real competitive advantage.

"  ...And then you realise the Ec6 is being sold for $52,441 and actually comes with a knob to change the fan direction instead of having to find a specific area buried in the settings menu of the ""advanced"" dashboard screen.

I honestly think Tesla's software and battery tech is second to none but the company has become yet another over hyped American company. The software and battery tech is great but if the build quickly of their cars is like this then surly they can't justify a $60,000 price. for that price you could get:

Audi SQ5, 

Mercedes-Benz ML-Class, 

Audi A6, 

BMW 4 Series, 

Lexus GX 460

Now obviously those aren't EV's but you get the gist, cars at a similar price point have a wayy better build quality and unless Tesla step their game up, the allure of its self driving tech and fully electric capabilities will only last so long before consumers start realising that once you scratch below the surface a little, the Tesla fundamentally right now inst that good of a car.

For someone based in the EU, if NIO start selling over here, eventually i can see them easily becoming the better car to buy if they can improve their battery swapping tech/efficiency and their software i.e self driving (which they are developing right now).

I think Tesla's saving grace up t this point has been their lack of competition. But now that others are getting serious about EV's, it could mean hard times ahead for Tesla. Until they up their build quality, their brand image will be what helps them to continue to sell cars over their nearest competitors.

"I'm based in the UK and i see lots of people using Huawei phones even after it's negative 5g news. I think the recent human right violations of the Uyghurs has been less than positive for Chinese brands in the eu/west,  but it also feels like it should include the likes of Apple as they build their iphones there.

Volvo is owed by a Chinese company and their cars are built in China. People still buy Volvo's in the UK and they're known to be well made, long lasting cars that won't let you down. Obviously Volvo was originally Swedish so that probably helps with their brand image. However, seeing their performance after their Chinese takeover,  I think this proves China does have what it takes to be a big player in the world of car brands.

 I like that there's links with Volkswagen due to JAC Motors manufacturing NIO's current lineup of cars and think this link with Volkswagen could prove beneficial when they try to introduce cars into the EU market through Germany?

I also like that they've been operating their NIO Formula E Team for some time now. Not only will that help them to get their brand into the public eye of the west, but it also helps to give them credibility when they're competing in the same sport as Mercedes, BMW and other well known and liked car brands. I know lots of Motorsport fans who know of NIO through formula e solely. When they start selling cars to these markets, this brand recognition should help them as they won't be seen as a completely unknown, out of nowhere brand like i think xpeng motors would.

Obviously like you said, right now NIO find themselves in the very fortunate position of being based in a country with 1.4 billion people and with a rapidly growing middle class. They aren't under the pressure that other ev brands are under whereby they will need to expand quickly to other countries/markets in order to grow and meet sales numbers.

As an EV, from the video review, I would definitely choose it over Tesla, still gotta test drive it tho. But this is coming from someone who doesn't care about branding.

"The Chinese gov basically doesn't allow PCAOB to conduct the audits, and from the administration's POV, that is the issue regardless of whether or not a Chinese firm's financials are accurate.  In 2018, however, the PCAOB was on the administration shortlist to disband because it was perceived as being slow, ineffective, etc.  Same time, this issue has been a point of contention since 2013 when Chinese firms were first listed.  While Chinese firms account for 3 or 4% of US stock exchange market cap, or about $1.5T, Trump is looking for a scapegoat for his ineptitude, and seems uninterested in backing off since he seemingly wants to look tough on China and blame them for the virus and the economy and whatever else he can roll in with them. For members of Congress, they may be forced to support the initiative or risk being labeled soft on China, if it gets to a vote in the house.  He cut off China from the Fulbright program and Peace Corp missions recently as well.  American multinationals are not happy, because they don't want to lose the business opportunities in China.  But this isn't about what is rational, it's all about his ego and being a poor negotiator and throwing a temper tantrum.  So I wouldn't put it past him, despite that I think escalating this thing is really bad for the economy.  Until it's sorted out and we get adults in charge again in 2021 I think listed Chinese stock will be subdued.  Oh, and the Chinese exchanges represent around $12T market cap, but most American brokerages don't give investors a direct way to invest.  So if delisting does occur, followed by a move to Hong Kong exchange, there's a much smaller pool of capital bidding for shares, which hurts the Long term nio case.  Situation sucks.

I know a bit about EV as, until this morning, Nio was my only stock (bought 5 shares of Microsoft earlier today to have something more stable/less volatile) and I‚Äôve read recent news coming out. I‚Äôll google the annual report tomorrow. Here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôve probably spent more on shares of Nio than I can afford to lose. It feels like I‚Äôm gambling at times.

Look at the long term chart for TSLA, you will see large peaks from years ago where people took a quick buck - now look at it! This is not to say the same will happen with NIO , NIO is a young company that's had cash flow issues until being bailed out recently.

As long as Trump is the petty, vindictive POS he's shown himself to be for the entirety of his public life, I think it is entirely possible he'll tire of waiting for congress to act, especially now that he wants a new enemy to divert attention from his garbage handling of covid19 and the US economy, and issue an executive order delisting Chinese stocks.

"Some investing tips for individual stocks are to go to google and type in the company name & investor relations. Ex: Nio investor relations.

From the company website they have quarterly and annual earnings to look at to see their revenue, operating expenses, cash flow, etc. Compare the recent reports to past reports to see if the company is moving in the right direction or not.

There is also a conference call on that website so you can listen to the CEO and CFO discuss the numbers and future outlook.

Did Nio deserve to be a $1 stock last year? Yes it absolutely did because one quarter it lost almost half a billion dollars, burned alot of their cash reserves, AND CANCELLED the conference call that day. Future outlook was uncertain because it was unknown whether Nio can secure any funding to keep operating and there were fears of being delisted from the Nasdaq.

However, quarter after quarter it has been beating expectations, decreased their cash burn, and secured funding to keep operating for a long time. 

Yes Nio is still operating on a loss but did you know it took tesla 16 years to become profitable? Many companies are operating at a loss right now such as Uber, retail, airline industry, etc. The important thing is to see if their numbers are improving and if the company is growing to a path of profitability years ahead. 

I said in the comments last week that I wasn't worried about Nio stock price going down because Tesla releases earnings this week and the ev market goes up on Tesla outlook. What you should be doing is to do your company research on one quarter, invest if you see any upside, then wait till the next quarter and listen to conference call to see if you keep holding or dump. 

Right now I think Nio is undervalued and should be at least the price of the scam company Nikola.

"My estimate is 5530\~5630, which is another 48%\~50% growth from June!

Here is the math:

On July 18, NIO just celebrated their 50,000th car rolls off, which means there are 3,918 already (50,000-46,082(By 06/30/2020)=3,918)

In June, NIO has 3,740 delivered. In average the daily delivery# is 124.666 (3740/30=124.666..), In July, there are 13 days left. So using the most conservative approach, they can produce 1620 cars.

(124.666\*13=1620)

So the estimated delivery number is 5,538 (1620+3,918) minimal.",3.0,2020-07-19 05:14:22,311.0

"I haven't seen anything in regards to the numbers for EC6 preorders specifically, and I have a hunch we'll have to wait until the official Q2 report for that news. In regards to the production capacity NIO is working with JAC to increase the amount of cars they can produce on a monthly basis. Back in May it was reported by technode that they could only produce 4k cars a month max. The information I was given was that the ES8, ES6, and EC6 all use the same frame and can be built on the same production line, but I haven't tried to verify that piece of information. It also said in that technode article they planned on increasing their number to 5K per month by September. Considering they've already produced almost 4K cars with 1/3rd of the month remaining is a good sign that their production capability is scaling up. I wouldn't be surprised if they were able to increase the number to more than 5K a month by September since they're almost at that pace already. Sidenote comment, that production line bottleneck is the reason I was told why the ET7 the sedan that is the next anticipated model was postponed last year (since it's a different frame, and thus a different line would need to be assembled). 

Note: I am not an expert in car assembly lines, so if i butchered that explanation or have anything wrong about the process please forgive me.

"yeah you're right that it's a best case scenario, but I don't think it's impossible. I am just assessing they were low on excess/on-hand inventory due to the pandemic and the supply chain issues that came with it. Also, Nio reported that they had order backlogs since February when they posted their March delivery numbers. So since delivery numbers have been above 3k for April, May, and June with a reported production bottleneck of 4k per month, I don't think they had a bunch of ES6/ES8's lying around. Once again, this is mostly an assessment/opinion.

"it takes time to deliver, have you ever heard of the line ""Inventory"" in financial statements. My point is, the important metric is the # of cars built, and in this case, we do not know. The BEST case scenario is about 4000 cars in 18 days, which I consider actually pretty good. I'm expecting above 10,000 deliveries (12-13k built) in Q2 2020 and we're going to the moon.

Edit: for example, Nio had about $136 million in Inventory at the end of Q1 2020, those are cars built but NOT delivered. There's a whole logistic procedure going on to simply deliver a car. It's not done overnight.",2.0,2020-07-19 17:28:10,311.0

"I appreciate your willingness to have this discussion but there seems to be some holes in your argument and I would like to clarify:

1. Your argument might be valid if you only invested in value stocks but clearly this is a growth stock. I'm sure you've taken a look at Tesla's finances 4-6 years into their IPO
2. This is true but this is also based on the premise that Tesla's valuation is 'nonsensical'. You didn't back that up at all and this is arguing that the EV market is just a bubble, which is a completely different argument itself and not specific for NIO. If you really want to short companies based on PS ratios, there are many better companies to short, i.e. NKLA lol
3. Yup.
4. Sure, it's possible. Is it likely to happen in the near future? No, I think their gov/bank/tencent funding will last them for at least the next 2 years and by that point, their sales will have grown tremendously based on their projections
5. This is false. China's GDP grew by 3.2% last quarter, their economy is actually booming. People in China are at the point where they rarely even wear masks anymore because many big cities are no longer reporting cases. (source: friends living in China, and the internet). If more cases come up, China is very good at handling it
6. ""Fixated"" is misleading. They market themselves as a lifestyle brand. They mainly sell cars and offer some other products and services. Your opinion that they should not sell other products is just that, an opinion. This is ironic that you said not to speak opinions yet you just stated one. To counter your opinion, I think the NIO houses are really cool and offer a competitive edge/sales tactic for people who want more exclusivity.
7. Similarly, this is anecdotal. You think the brand is weak because your 2 friends living in china have never heard of it? Who are your friends? Are they Chinese? Are they looking to buy electric cars? I've heard from people in China that their brand is popping off this year. Maybe try asking your friends again in 6 months

3. Who knows, but I am in long term and Nio is showing good growth.

Goldman Sachs downgraded them on Friday saying the stock was worth $7, which caused the stock to drop rapidly. Then on the very same day Goldman Sachs went out and purchased nearly 750,000 shares at a price range somewhere between $11-$13.

"Overall, an excellent pros and cons list for being a NIO bear.  I agree with most of your points here.

However, I will have to disagree with Point 5 and 6 on Cons.

While everyone's economic growth  has gone negative compared to 1 year ago, China is up 3% right now. I am confident that China will outperform all other economies in this upcoming global recession. Even if China decides to only produce for its local market, that's enough to keep growth positive (maybe 0-1% growth?). I can't say the same for countries that are dependent on cheap Asian goods though. Quoting from WSJ, "" With the second-quarter growth, China is looking more like a bright spot in a world ravaged by the pandemic. The International Monetary Fund expects China‚Äôs economy will grow 1.2% for the full year, which would make it the only large economy to report positive data in 2020"".

Number 6  of your cons seems like a personal opinion. I will give you some facts from the latest ADS offering statement. 

""We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering mainly to fund our cash investments in NIO China, as well as other working capital needs. We expect NIO China will use the cash investments as follows: (i) approximately 30% on research and development of products, services and technology; (ii) approximately 15% on development of our manufacturing facilities and roll-out of our supply chain; (iii) approximately 40% on operation and development of our sales and service network; and (iv) the remaining for general business support purpose"".",2.0,2020-07-19 12:25:03,321.0

$48 end of year.

NIO will be one of the winners in this race of mobile electrification. I believe their biggest competitive advantage is the battery as a service or BAAS.  The living dynamic in China are multi-residential buildings.  This answers the need of the market.  The wait time is as fast as pumping gasoline.

Sales keeps skyrocketing, so thus BAAS. Very similar to the iPhone - Apps ecosystem.  You cannot live without the other.

" 

Just have a question as I am not understanding why my the profit seems to be similar for short selling vs buying put options.

I bought 15 Nov 20th 2020 $10 NIO Puts on July 13th for roughly $2.25 each when the price of NIO was roughly \~ 15.50 at the time.

Today they are worth roughly $2.90 when the price of NIO is at $11.00.

My price = 15 x $2.25 x 100 = $3375, today 15 x $2.90 x 100 = 4350. I am making roughly $975 atm.

If I were to short $3375 worth of shares at $15.50, I would be shorting about 217 shares.

At today's price, my profit would be ($15.50 - $11) x 217 = $976.5.

I know option pricing factor in a lot of things but in this scenario, I don't seem to be profiting much more from leverage. Why is this the case?",1.0,2020-07-18 15:18:50,330.0

Best advice I can give is this: holding long is possible but is a lot less financially painful if you have positions for the volitile stock in a few different accounts. That way you can sell off one position, taking profit after a huge run loses momentum and shorts take a dominant stance that bulls can't counter. You can hold the second position if you feel your price average is exceptionally low and wait for momentum to return (don't try to pick the bottom to buy more... rarely works unless you are really good at reading charts). With momentum clearly returning or strong ER news, start buying back in with the account you sold for profit taking. Don't be afraid to sell for profit.

"Not sure on the margins but they have paid JAC 604 million RMB (in total since their contracts started). They pay JAC for each vehicle produced on a monthly basis. I believe their contract will end in 2022 so they may be getting their own manufacturing plant then.

Advantages are that they can start selling cars much quicker than they would if they had spent the time and money on developing their own manufacturing factory. Currently there is a lot of market share to grab in a quickly growing market and time is a factor at play.

Disadvantages are obviously the margins being lower for the short term",4.0,2020-07-17 01:09:18,336.0
"No idea on the margin but with using it as a 3rd party manufacturer, main  advantage comes from neo not having to spend a lot of money on creating and maintaining their own assembly lines especially while their actual production volume is still relatively low. 

Another advantage is that I highly imagine that neo will have a clause in the contract between them saying if Jac has any manufacturing problems for neo cars (perhaps a fire on the assembly line shutting production down) they should have a compensation clause to neo for failing to deliver on time.

Of course, that leads to the disadvantages where any manufacturing issues are completely out of your hand and if there are any, something that wasn't your fault will reflect badly on you.

So from what I'm reading about wtf happened to Tesla today, investors got hit with margin increase notices in anticipation for S&P inclusion.  Brokerages are trying to make more shares available by raising margin requirements on retail investors forcing them to sell shares or add more funds.  Etrade for example gives you the chance to sell off shares, or eventually just does it for you.  Sounds like all the big money out there proceeded to to sell off quick, leading to a bizarre first I can think of situation where a stock that rose $200 a share single day in premarket, then ended red.  In theory, money will all start pumping again leading to Tesla's earnings next week and buzz about S&P inclusion.

But I've been kicking myself the past six months because I always think it's peaked and then it takes off again.  I remember when Elon's goal was $420 and seemed so farfetched, then I remember thinking $1000 was the absolute highest it could possibly go a couple months ago , and then look at this morning it was at $1780.  At this point I would rather lose money than keep missing out, then at least have some closure.

Tesla's suit claimed that the design work done for the Model S sedan by Fisker Coachbuild was substandard, and that Fisker Automotive diverted its best ideas to the Karma.[79] On November 4, 2008 CNET News reported that Tesla Motors would discontinue its suit after an interim ruling in favor of Fisker et al.[80] A news release on the Fisker Automotive website stated that Tesla was ordered to pay US$1,144,285 in costs.[81]",1.0,2020-07-15 13:16:41,362.0

"You reserve the battery swap on a location on the app. Depending on the order of cars (there may be a queue of 2-5 cars, or 0), the operator comes and sits in your car. He drives into to the booth. Not that easy for some drivers, I guess, because you need to reverse up a ramp and it‚Äôs not super big. The operator also initiates the battery swap. I guess there are 10 to 30 batteries on charge. Sometimes in rush hour they don‚Äôt have a full-battery available, they‚Äôll give you the choice: 80% full or wait 20 minutes. Depending on the next trip, 80% may be enough. And you can also always quick-charge it yourself. Some battery swap places are really at parking places: This one had a Tesla Supercharger station also, plus a McDonald‚Äôs. Others have a full-fledged Nio house with a lounge, caf√© and some merch for sale. The battery swap is free btw, included in the price of the vehicle.",22.0,2020-07-12 02:18:06,367.0

These swap stations might work right now since they are only selling 4-5k cars a month, but what about when there are 300k cars on the road? They only hold 20-30 batteries. So only 30 cars a day get this luxury?

"One thing is that at least with Nio you get both options: battery swap or charging. I think the scaling would come from most people just charging in the night, and battery swap just being used for long trips, which few people take ‚Äî but most parking spots in China don't have charging function yet. And yeah it's certainly a bit annoying, the car is sold with nice promises and sometimes you call ahead \*Do you have batteries left?\* and they say sure ‚Äî when you arrive 10 minutes later they say \*Sorry you need to wait 20 minutes for a full one\*. This is alright if you're at a Nio house with coffee, toilets and seats, but annoying if you're in a parking lot in the middle of nowhere and you just wish you had an old fuel car.",3.0,2020-07-12 12:02:19,367.0

I'm also interested to know how a swap station handles the charging. Can they charge 20-30 at a time and do they have a faster charge rate then a supercharger without the need for a consumer friendly charger?

I wrote a blog post covering the basics :  [https://mybornean.blogspot.com/2020/06/creating-my-own-arkk-innovation-etf-1.html](https://mybornean.blogspot.com/2020/06/creating-my-own-arkk-innovation-etf-1.html) . Obviously, I'm not writing down all my thoughts there as I continue to learn something new. 

It's a still new company and in its infancy. it could pay off big but it could also go out of business. Competition in China is FIERCE.  I believe XPeng is the one to beat. Though, I am more inclined to think  the three semi luxurious car makers can make it in China (Nio, Tesla, XPeng). There may be more though. I don't always follow Chinese EV news. 

If you're thinking Chinese government invested in NIO. Guess, what even SOE can go bankrupt in China and the ""government"" that invested in Nio is actually the investment arm of Hefei municipality. Their goals is to make money. Does not mean that they will bail out Nio if it were to go under. 

Read up Country Driving : A Chinese Road Trip by Peter Hessler for an insight on how Chinese economy works. Do note that it was written almost 10 years ago and China has changed enormously. 

My post may look negative/bearish on Nio but I'm a long term bull. I'm just a little bit more realistic on it. I don't buy it can be $100 in a year or two but then again we can't predict the market. I mean, NKLA has more market cap than Nio for God's sake!",9.0,2020-07-11 17:14:33,372.0

"Not to be THAT GUY and I respect everyone‚Äôs opinion, but I wouldn‚Äôt call NIO a ‚Äúnew company‚Äù. Let me explain with an example. I think you know Koenigsegg, right? Well that was a total new company, started from the bottom, and now works with Volvo and Polestar, and kicks Bugatti‚Äôs ass. Nio never was a newborn company, the first years of their life they secured a safe place in formula e, and if this shitty coronavirus goes away and NIO wins races, that will give them lot of exposure. My point being: would you call a company in its infancy when it already has a safe place in formula e, and is supported by the government?",3.0,2020-07-11 20:11:46,372.0
"Never a bad idea to lock in some profits.  Stocks don't typically produce 170% returns in a month forever.  I bought $3000 last month which is now worth $7500, my plan is to take my original $3000 out  on monday and ride the $4500 gains I made long term.

This way if it doesn't work out I'm out nothing, and if it does keep going up, I'm still in more than my original investment for the long run.

I feel a lot of people here don't want to admit, a lot of the gains NIO has received recently are directly correlated to Tesla's stock price, which has also had a killer month.  I think NIO is still a great hold long term, but we are definitely at the top of the short term bubble.

"Let me play the devil's advocate here. I don't think Formula E will give Nio that much exposure in China. Don't think that it's THAT popular in China. 

There's a big difference between local government (Hefei) and the central government I would think. Although I think what Nio is doing is in line with what the central government want. I just want people to look at Nio more objectively. Local government investment arm invested in Nio != Central government has a stake in Nio. If anyone is confused what the heck Hefei City Construction and Investment Holding Group is, think of it as a Sovereign Wealth Fund but owned by the city government. 

I stand by my statement that Nio is still a relatively new company. The next few quarters will either make or break them. They're getting capital inject + new line of credit. If everything goes to plan, they and a few more Chinese EV manufacturers will dominate car sales in China. At that point, they would probably taking export market seriously. What their stock price is will be anyone's guess.

"I'm long on this stock.

Delisting will never happen for all the reasons that many have pointed out in multiple posts and discussion groups. 

I'm not even thinking of stock price, I'm judging this offering on its potential and rate it favourably when compared with Tesla. NIO has reached the point it has more quickly and much more efficiently than Tesla, it has a great product, and is in a position to become the leading premium EV manufacturer in China. It's literally the Chinese Tesla - noting that the Chinese tend to prefer Chinese products, so I think it will do very well. 

China is way ahead of the rest of the world in its wide-spread adoption of smart technology and infrastructure. There is also a government subsidy for purchasing electric cars, but the criteria to qualify just happens to exclude all EVs, with the exception of NIO. 

IMO, this is an undervalued and overlooked stock. It's unbelievable that people are buying NKLA stock (a company with nothing but an idea) for over $50, while this gem is approx. $15 at the time of writing.

I have an investment thesis on Nio (Speculative but still I believe in the company) and will stick with it long term (Doesn't mean I won't swing trade them if I see a chance). Most certainly will buy on a dip near my average price. I have averaged up a few times.

I don't believe Nio is a scam. If it were, i doubt Chinese state owned banks are loaning them 1.4 billion USD.

They seem to be worried that the second wave of this pandemic will cause more instability -- but whose second wave? America's? China's? Did stocks really dive because of covid? Not really (well, mines all went up a lot). China went through another wave already.

"I'll shed some light on this for you. Due to strict capital control in China there are limits on how much money an individual can ""send"" (or simply invest) overseas. As Nio is listed on the NYSE this falls into that category. So what a lot of more wealthy people in China do is open a bank account in Hong Kong. Through this bank account they can access all capital markets more freely. As of right now regular Chinese retail investors have no other way to invest directly into Nio besides through the way I described.

I hope that answers your question. To add more information, a lot of regular Chinese retail investors simply stick to their domestic stock markets such as the Shanghai composite, Shenzhen market etc. This is also why the Shanghai composite lobbied Alibaba to have they secondary listing on there instead of in HK.",3.0,2020-07-09 12:09:53,395.0

They are still able to send a certain amount of money overseas though. Chinese ADRs are pretty popular among them. They're called night trader or something. I can't remember the Chinese term.

This is not unique to China as people in my country also will have a hard time investing overseas due to regulation. There isn't any capital control per se, but regulation (or lack of) makes it difficult/expensive to.",2.0,2020-07-11 16:03:10,395.0

If you believe in it like you say you do, then you shouldn't be worried about the prices. just revisit this stock in 1-5 years. I got in at a super cheap price but i haven't been afraid to purchase as it increases.

Edit:  after reading this:

I think the answer is: when they can produce cars and batteries that meet European and American standards.  Not just safety standards but also quality standards.  Tesla has done well to set the bar pretty high, or at least clear an already high bar.  
The article says the company produces 20000 cars, and had 4800 battery recalls.  But they do so battery swaps, so that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean ~1/4 of thier cars were recalled., but it still seems like a lot of recalls .  
That said I don‚Äôt see nio being the next Tesla.  It might take a while for nio to meet higher standards, they may not want or need to!

I shared that on another post and figure that it could be of interest to other.

 NIO delivered 3,155 vehicles in April 2020 &  3,436 vehicles in May 2020 making 6,591 in total. If June is at 3.2k deliveries, they will be well over 9k deliveries for the quarter.

It would be their record quarter and about a 3 times improvement YoY and QoQ.

I have been buying in segments (I buy more every few weeks) and today I brought more at 7.25. I know that sounds high (I mistakenly  bought way to early in the day) but I am in this for the long term so it does not matter... My personal belief is that NIO stock will be somewhere in the range of $50 min to $100 max per share within the next 52 weeks. I am very bullish on this stock long term.... Just my opinion though.,9.0,2020-06-17 13:47:41,431.0
"I'm not in on this stock anymore (which is one of my mistakes lately) but it just broke out of the channel I drew a while back (around January 22nd peak) and based on the fib I drew when it dropped in October (all time low) it's right there at 0.382.

I would be optimistic that it can go back to ATH with another delivery numbers for June making it a great Q2 and the heavy demand lately for a second Tesla but a real one, not that scam that is Nikola. 

I consider NIO as the only serious competitor to Tesla.
Looking at it now, I actually should re-enter.

"So basically NIO is offering to sell more percentage of their company to the public through shares in order to raise the funds necessary to continue their strategic growth. Lets hypothetically say they had 1 million shares available to the public before hand that made up 20% of the total company, and now they are offering another 1 million shares bringing the total ownership of NIO in the public to 40%. This gives up some of their ownership, but raised them a substantial amount of capital so that they can use the money to invest in the growth of their company. Ideally, the growth will make their 60% ownership worth more than their 80% ownership prior if their strategic investments play out as they plan. They are currently taking advantage of the obvious interest in their company to offer shares at a price that is adventageous to them ($5.95) in hopes that the interested public will see that this price is still a good value and will buy up the shares and give NIO the capital they need for their investment plans. TESLA did this exact maneuver in Febuary. They took advantage of their increased interest and decided to offer shares at a price that was currently valued at a reasonable price to the public which in turn played out adventageous for both the buying (public) and selling (tesla) parties. When more shares are offered to the public WITHOUT significant current interest in the company, this kind of offering can lead to share price decline due to dilution. However, a company where investors can see a bright future and a good investment via financial reports, ect. can offer these shares in a time of growth and benefit without the dilution effecting price TOO much due to the counterbalance of the offering price still being a good long term current price value investment for the public. Hope this helps a bit!",9.0,2020-06-13 18:10:56,432.0

"Questions:

JAC: We have no details about the VW relationship. More automakers in Hefei would be good thing. If JAC will work closely with VW if shouldn't affect NIO manufacturing. 

Hefei Agreement: NIO China opens the RMB financing channel. We believe NIO China meets the requirements to go public in China. NIO Inc will hold controlling stake in NIO China for the long term. NIO Inc has redemption rights and right to purchase more shares and repurchase rights for partial holdings on NIO China. 

Orders: Since late April order growth rate has returned to rate before Coronavirus. Momentum is very positive. 

Gross Margin Q2: We believe vehicle gross margin over 5%. Overall over 3%. 

US China Relation: Closely monitor.

Capacity: Many users have been waiting for deliveries. Hefei plant monthly capacity 4,000 units at 10 hours daily. Supply chain partners have capacity constraints to 3,400-3,500 units. Boost capacity in overall supply chain system. Plans August and September increased to around 4,500 to 5,000. Quite conservative in production capacity increase. Strong momentum on demand side. 

R&D Expenses: Q1 Cost Control optimizations. Expenses in Q2 increased over Q1. Confident to reduce operating loss. 

NIO Cash: Inject 2.4B into NIO China. Closely monitor market for future financing plans. 

Vehicle Margin: Expect gross margin double digits by end of 2020.

NIO House vs NIO Space: Most vehicle sales happen in Houses and Online. Houses in big cities. Spaces play bigger role in 3rd quarter for lower tiered cities. 70% sales through houses and Online. 

EC6 Deliveries and Price: Start deliveries in September.

100kWh: Start deliveries in Q4. Power density improvement. No performance improvement. 

Hefei: Work together with government to work specific policy. Should be able to be preferantial policy.

Future Product Launch: NIO Day cannot disclose details. Do not want to break tradition of new launch every year. 

Cash Flow: Existing cash can be injected into NIO China. Monitor the market carefully to raise future capital for future development injection. 

Volume: Cannot disclose order backlog. ES8 ramp up production and deliveries. 1 to 3 es8 to es6. EC6 no pricing strategy yet and production.",5.0,2020-05-29 01:05:44,458.0

"The market isn't responding better because the large increase was expected due to subdued ordering in February/March which led to:

(i) lower numbers in February/March and thus a lower denominator for your comparison

(ii) higher numbers in April as demand was pushed from Feb/Mar to April thus creating a larger numerator for your comparison

&#x200B;

A month over month increase coming out of a pandemic and national lock down in China doesn't seem like a particularly useful data point.

&#x200B;

As to the year over year increase its impressive but:

(i) even if April levels are sustained for the full year the increase would be \~55%

(ii) again, April #'s are probably high as they contain a lot of demand from Feb/March so extrapolating them through the rest of the year might be aggressive

(iii) On the low-end if we extrapolate the first 4 month delivery total (6,993) throughout the rest of the year we get YoY growth of just 2% (not saying this is a reasonable expectation either but the likely bounds are probably 2-55% YoY growth in '20 as things stand).

(iv) 2019 delivery growth was 80% and seen as a disappointment.  '20 is likely to represent a meaningful slowdown vs. '19.  On the other hand, TSLA's YoY delivery growth was (from 2012 when they sold \~3k cars): 765%, 41%, 60%, 51%, 35%, 138%, 50%.

Nice analysis. NIO will still need to raise money as they have yet to figure out how to be a lean company. Auto sales are a must and Tesla is still crushing it....with the Chinese govt assistance.

Could Nio ever reach Tesla levels?,1.0,2020-04-30 11:36:01,480.0
"The problem is what they had to give up to get the cash - which was 25% of the assets!  Getting cash is obviously good, operationally, for a cash strapped company but what it costs is important and telling about valuation.  Would it be good overall if they sold 99% of the assets for $1bln?  Clearly not so there is some level at which selling a portion of your assets for $1bln is good and some level where it is not - this deal would seem to fall squarely on the ""not good"" side of that line.

That is, the problem is they sold parts of the company at prices which are roughly equal to $1.50/share for NIO.  Large, deep pocketed, intelligent people (Chinese Communist Party officials) with access to lots of information and insight you don't have only paid $1.50/share (and they get the benefit of having most of the money they invest reinvested in their local economies!).  That should tell you something - if NIO could have raised money at a valuation of $3.50/share they would have done it but obviously no one wanted  to invest $1bln at that valuation - large, intelligent investors with good insight into the company are telling you its over-valued.",1.0,2020-05-01 01:35:17,480.0
"You are correct and it is always possible that the Chinese government got a great deal (or we'll all find out they got a great deal).  The thing you should spend time thinking about is:

* Nio needed to raise a large amount of $
* Nio looked everywhere for this money for the past year
* Presumably, no one was offering a better deal than the Chinese government investors
* The Chinese government investors are buying in at a value which implies NIO's stock is worth \~$1.50/share
* The Chinese government investors know more about the business than you (they know things the company hasn't disclosed, they've spoken with the CEO extensively, they've seen income statement/balance sheet information that hasn't yet been disclosed publicly)
* The Chinese investors don't need to get a great return on their investment for it to be a success (since part of the appeal is having that money reinvested in their communities)

It should be concerning that the best price NIO could raise money at is \~$1.50/share when the stock is trading $3.00+.  That's a HUGE gap and implies public equity investors are over-valuing the company since no large financial or strategic buyer was willing to pay anywhere close to the current public market valuation.

Yes, it could be that all the large buyers are wrong and NIO will outperform their expectations but as a NIO equity investor you're starting from a huge disadvantage - you need those expectations to be blown away just to break even at \~$3.00/share.",2.0,2020-05-01 01:41:55,480.0
"I would also just add that your statement "" they expect to be gross margin profitable in Q2.. if this holds true, this alone will increase the price of the stock""

Isn't necessarily true - it's *probably* true but at $3 is NIO embedding an expectation that they turn gross margin profitable?  If they fail to turn gross margin profitable does the stock fall a lot?

Beyond that, buying a stock on the basis that you think an operational metric is going to improve and push the stock price higher is more speculation than investing.  Buying stocks in a vacuum without consideration for the price you are paying and what that price says about future cash-flow, cash raising needs/dilution etc. is going to end in tears.",2.0,2020-05-01 01:49:21,480.0

"I cannot answer that question and anyone who claims they can is deluded or lying.

What I can tell you is that the deal agreed to yesterday makes it harder since \~25% of the business was sold at a huge discount to the current trading price of NIO which is itself at a MASSIVE discount to the trading price of TSLA.",2.0,2020-05-01 05:30:24,480.0

"Still, those investors that bought the stock at a discount (it‚Äôs expected btw) are expecting the stock to grow. They are not betting against the stock. If they got a discount, great for them but it does not have any implications on the companies‚Äô future, but only makes makes sure that they are back on track. Whatever nios plan is, I can bet that they are not worrying about a discount but just happy that they are now well funded so they can continue to grow",3.0,2020-05-02 06:11:50,480.0
"Discounts are expected but discounts of \~50% are not expected for this sort of transaction and are a sign of desperation.  In keeping with that, what you seem to be missing is that people in a better position than you or I to assess the prospects for NIO's future were unwilling to outbid the Chinese government investors.  That is, no one was willing to buy in to Nio China (let alone put new money into Nio) at an implied price of, say, $2/share for NIO but the stock is changing hands in the public markets for \~$3-3.50.   That is a worrying data point and it does matter - a company's value is not binary around ""they are worried about securing funding"" and ""they have secured enough funding for 12 months of operations"" - many more things matter.",1.0,2020-05-03 16:32:36,480.0
"No one said Nio is a guaranteed ‚Äòskyrocket to the moon‚Äô company, it‚Äôs got its early stage struggles like any other company burning out their cash I.e. Tesla. It‚Äôs a gamble for anyone, just because some ppl have a bit more inside information than us doesn‚Äôt mean that they know everything about the prospects of its business - they can only make educated assumptions. 

Furthermore, the pandemic contributes significantly to peoples decisions right now since they don‚Äôt know how things still play out. Put yourself in chinese investors shoes and ask yourself if you would pay more than the given discount during covid 19. Seems to me that the government is betting on nio to grow and is lucky that no one will outbid them because the virus is unpredictable right now, although things seemed to have returned to normal in China for now. 

There‚Äôs so many external factors so don‚Äôt just think ‚Äòinvestors have more inside information than us so therefore the company is going down‚Äô. More importantly, the government is expecting nio to grow so don‚Äôt forget to analyze why they are willing to invest in the company.",0.0,2020-05-05 02:49:57,480.0

"Questions we need answered before we can parse this announcement:

1) Will it be finalized (no way to know that today)?

2) What terms will Hefei demand for the financing?  Jobs, manufacturing facilities, equity, tax revenue?  Media outlets are reporting that manufacturing facilities would be part of the deal and Li is saying after the agreement the company will continue hiring in Hefei (from its current 200 employee base) but other offices won't be impacted.

3) What will the cost of meeting Hefei's terms be to NIO?  Hefei's not writing a 10bln RMB check to defend 200 jobs - they're going to expect new investment worth at least 10bln RMB.

&#x200B;

The stock is selling off because these questions aren't being answer (and, to a lesser extent, because the market as a whole is selling off).  If NIO needs to build a $500m manufacturing facility and hire 2,000 people in Hefei this agreement doesn't help NIO a whole lot.

"Incorrect.  Almost for certain the people behind this purchase are NOT making a bet that the stock will be above $3.07 in 6 months.  They are almost certainly making the bet that they can short \~33m shares above $3.07 in the day(s) after they buy the bond.

What the purchasers are doing is paying $100m for \~33m shares of Nio (\~$3/share) to be delivered 6 months from now.  They then are almost certainly going and shorting \~33m shares in the open market to close out their effective position.  If they short those shares at $4 (around where the stock has been) they raise \~$132m from short sale proceeds.  In 6 months they get their \~33m shares from the convertible bond and use those to close out their short position.  Excluding borrow fees (which currently are quite low) they'll net $32m ($132m - $100m) over 6 months on a $100m investment.  That's a FABULOUS rate of return and a no brainer for the buyer.  Anyone who could would do this trade.  The results/profit from the trade are totally independent of what the stock does; NIO goes bankrupt the buyers make \~$30m (they actually could make more in this one special case); NIO goes to $20 the buyers make \~$30m; Nio stays at $4 the buyers make \~$30m.

The fact that NIO could only raise money on such bad terms (giving away $30m to raise $100m) should be a concerning sign.  News reports indicate they weren't in a position to make payroll this past week and probably needed these funds to do so; this is a terrible sign of dysfunction and financial pain at NIO.",2.0,2020-02-15 08:11:34,525.0

(2) Even more idiotic is your statement. No one is shorting 33m shares (or 60m if you include the second tranche). There's not enough shares to borrow for that to happen.

1) How does your response contradict anything I said?  Yes, they have a large economic interest in the company (I don't, and haven't, disputed that!) but, contrary to recent posts, have not been buying additional equity.  This despite NIO selling equity at VERY generous terms.  This is a fact and you haven't disputed it so let's move on.

&#x200B;

2) There almost certainly are 33mm shares available to short!  Interactive Brokers (just one broker with inventory from just 5 lenders!) lists "">10,000,000"" shares available to short.  IBKR's system won't display values above 10 million so it could be a much larger number!

[https://i.imgur.com/d6RnijY.png](https://i.imgur.com/d6RnijY.png)

Further, according to Bloomberg, short interest peaked at YE 2019 at 223.8m shares and there were still shares available to short at year end (if memory serves I think availability was still >10m at the time!).  At 1/31/2019 short interest was just 149.7m shares.  That'sa  difference of 74m shares - sure seems like there should be 33m shares available to short!

&#x200B;

3) First off, my point here was in reference to the claim made in another post that Charles Schwab and State Street purchasing Nio shares was ""hedge fund"" buying.  It isn't and I don't get the sense you're trying to dispute that so I'll assume you accept my original point was correct.

As to your conteion that there are, in fact, hedge funds that own Nio - this is arguably true (though again, I'm not seeing any evidence of significant hedge fund *buying* \- either from you or from Bloomberg/SEC Filings - in fact, some recent filings from Temasek and Hillhouseindicated informed investore *selling)*.

As to hedge funds who own NIO I would point out that most of them (i) don't own very much stock and (ii) are not ""fundamental"" long buyers - they're places like Citadel where you have no idea what they're doing and their position probably changes every 2 weeks (they may be selling calls and buying stock as an arbitrage with no clear view on the underlying business).  If you'd like to name some hedge funds who have recently been buying Nio in size (let's say since YE) - I'd be very interested to know!",0.0,2020-02-15 12:10:51,526.0

"TLDR:

**NIO delivered 1,598 vehicles in January 2020**, 11.5% lower than the same month last year. This decrease was primarily due to the reduction in business days in January due to the comparatively earlier Chinese New Year holiday in 2020. The extended holiday due to the unfortunate outbreak of the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China also affected our sales results. January 2020 deliveries consisted of 1,493 ES6s, the Company‚Äôs 5-seater high-performance premium electric SUV, and 105 ES8s, the Company‚Äôs 7-seater high-performance premium electric SUV and its 6-seater variant.

By right the valuation of their stock should be $2, because of the funding in talk with GAC. It shoot up to $5, Now It back to $4. (Over valuation)

Can you explain why dilution is good for us?,1.0,2020-01-18 14:21:26,569.0
"(Edited)

At the face of it, it may seem like it‚Äôs not good because you lose a bit of your overall % ownership. But the pie is getting bigger, and a smaller piece of a much bigger pie means more money in absolute terms.

Example:

When u own 20% of a company that‚Äôs worth $1m, you may get diluted several times after additional rounds of equity financing.. and end up owning 5% of a company that‚Äôs worth $10m

20% of $1m = $200k, whereas 5% of $10m = $500k (hence dilution is good).

That said, this normally works when the value of the stock keeps going up as the additional funding and dilution occurs, and not when the value of the stock is dropping (except if the additional funding, even at a lower valuation, can help pick up a company‚Äôs valuation ‚Äòeventually‚Äô..)

So in Nio‚Äôs case, two things could have happened (assuming Bailley bought new issued stock, hence dilution):

Option 1: If Bailley bought the stock at $4.4 (current trading price) that‚Äôs (in theory) ‚Äòbad‚Äô dilution ... because it would be a ‚Äúdown round‚Äù compared to their $6 IPO price. Unless, as I mentioned earlier, this additional capital, even if at a down round, can help propel Nio to gain more substantial traction eventually and the eventual value of the stock will be much higher in the future, so we all win, despite aggressive dilution initially. That would be the worst case scenario at the face of it (but hardly that bad since it‚Äôs only 30M shares of 730M shares), however, it would have a happy ending eventually (if the company can keep growing)..

Option 2: Nio goes to new 3rd party investors (e.g  Sovereign Wealth Funds) and manages to convince brand new shareholders to buy new stock at $6, $7, $8, etc in which case, Bailley has, as traditional existing large shareholder do, a clause called ‚Äúfirst right of refusal‚Äù. It means they have the priority to buy any new issued stock before the new 3rd party. Why is that? Because big existing shareholders like Bailey have substantial voting power that they don‚Äôt want to lose to dilution, so they‚Äôd rather buy any new stock, even if more expensive (assuming a 3rd party is willing to pay that expensive price), so that they maintain or even increase their shareholding portion for voting purposes, etc. so Nio would basically go to its existing big shareholders and say ‚Äúhey, the Saudi Public Investment Fund (for example) wants to buy new issued stock for $6 per share. You guys can buy that new stock first before them, but if you don‚Äôt, we will take the Saudis offer). That‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter dilution‚Äù than option 1, because new stock is issued at a higher stock price compared to scenario 1

Point is. Dilution means a drop in % ownership per investor (which means an effective drop in share price) in order to raise new interest-free financing (better than raising debt because there‚Äôs no interest on it, and they don‚Äôt have to pay it back, unlike debt financing). 

So if u believe Nio will do great if it can only get its hands on some more cash, given its growth and the macro situation in China, then u would want to sacrifice a tiny initial drop in share price (initially) due to dilution, 4-5% tops, which will then recover eventually in folds. 

With all that said, even after the announcement today, the stock price did NOT drop. I think this is exactly because of what I just said, because net net, this is good news for Nio‚Äôs cash situation and its ability to now deliver on its potential.

"Of course it‚Äôs good news; Baillie Gifford and Co. were already one of the biggest shareholders. 

Two scenarios:

1) If Nio just issued new stocks, normally this means their existing major shareholders have the ‚Äúfirst right of refusal‚Äù, which means they get the priority to buy any new stock the company issues before any new buyers pick up the new stocks. If that‚Äôs what happening, that means Nio just picked up $130M in additional funding (interest free funding, since it is equity funding not debt funding). In which case, all of us shareholders would get diluted and lose approx 4% of our stock value in theory (which is nothing in the world of Nio and I‚Äôll happily give up even 10% of my stock value if it means Nio picking up $1b in cash to keep building on its momentum. I think that‚Äôs why you see the stock still going up despite a small dilution.

B) If the announcement is for existing stock, not new stock (I.e a big trade), then it‚Äôs also good news because it means one of their biggest shareholders wants more skin in the game.

"Comments 66

A couple of things to counter your point:

On margin, higher volume will lead to better gpm as you have better negotiating power with suppliers. Also, nio guarantees a minimum to be paid to Jac, and nio volume is not close to the minimum amount yet. So more volume will help with that gross margin. I believe company said they expect positive gpm for 2020

On volume, I think it's the key here. Nio has 70 nio spaces + nio houses now and they plan to do 200 totla by Dec 2020, this will for sure boost the volume as you expand into more locations. Also, company comment that for the past 2 months, orders have been 100+ per day, which means Nio can simply push out 3000+ monthly easily with just current orderbook, excluding any new orders you can get from more nio sites. In addition, nio said 45% of its customers are referred by existing... So that shows the brand loyalty here and imagine the compounding effect here. I would imagine it will be very easy for nio to get 4000 per month by March (Jan is only half a month given cny, and Feb inventory will be too low because of the cny impact as well to production)

Funding. 190.5 mm of the cb money is basically in, don't know the reason why there's still 10 mm not in but 90% of the ceo's commitment is fulfilled showed commitment at least. Nio will definitely need cash infusion in the next 1-2 months, but how they go about it is interesting. At 4 bn market cap, I would imagine it wouldn't be hard to do a private placement to existing large holders for 500 mm at a 15% discount? If nio can show progression for #1 and #2 above, I see no reason why people would not give them money, at 15% cheaper. We can check tesla's chart to see what happens to the stock price when they completed their funding (hint: it goes up). If you listen to the nio day, the chinese replay of earnings, and what company said during the shareholder meeting, it was clear that the new cfo wanted to use this earning to get the stock price up and THEN do a placement. The battery as a service concept which bin li mentioned about 5 times (even when people didn't ask) give you some sense that the earning call was basically a pitch to the institutional investors participating in the placement...

Battery as a service. I think it's a concept people still don't quite get. The way bin li talked about the battery as a service concept is huge and will for sure attract a lot attentions because it's essentially a reit concept where you manage the battery for customers and charge x% yield per year. Insurers and pension money would love to invest in that type of business if the gov really pushes for it (check the white paper, it's being mentioned quite a few times). The only other company doing it is baic, but they do only for taxis which is very bad. Unquestionably nio is the leader in this battery swapping concept now",1.0,2020-01-03 09:11:27,586.0

Investigating the ins and outs of the stock and picking as much dirt as possible in all the news outlet. Pretty sure they eat, breath, sleep about NIO. 

Parts of me would say that it's already priced into the stock just like the move we had today with the announcement award car of the year. But of course the market is irrational and driven by emotion ;)",2.0,2019-12-17 18:11:28,620.0

From ES8 and ES6 data, the 0% margin point is somewhere near 8k cars per quarter. However, the company also says the margin in Q3 will be lower due to the delivery of lower price models.

> It&#039;s the Chinese company&#039;s second round of cuts in the US this year, as NIO laid off 70 employees and closed a San Francisco office back in May. NIO began 2019 with 640 employees in Silicon Valley, according to financial filings.

"For about two years, the Nio EP9 sports car prototype had the fastest lap time of any electric vehicle on the grueling Nuerburgring Nordschleife at 6:45.90. Although the EP9's record fell last month to the Volkswagen IDR, the result proved that Nio's innovative technology could compete with the world's best. Nio founder and CEO William Li spoke to¬†Automotive News Europe¬†Correspondent Christiaan Hetzner during the Shanghai auto show about the EV maker's plans for Europe, competing with German rivals in China and the need for fresh funding after listing on the New York Stock Exchange.   


**The best chance for a Chinese automaker to break into the European market is with EVs. Does Europe appeal to you?**

Yes. We want to be a global brand. We have almost 200 people in Munich, for example. But we are still a very young company and have limited resources. If we expand abroad, we should be profitable. That's why we should be very careful when we expand outside of China because it's very easy to enter a market, but very hard to survive and win.  

**German brands dominate the Chinese premium car market. How can Nio break though?**  

We just entered the segment with a vehicle that is not cheap, it [the ES8] costs about $75,000. As a competitor to the Audi Q7 seven-seat premium large SUV, we have a market share of more than 10 percent, and that is just the beginning.

**Do you see the German automakers as dinosaurs that are too slow to react to new trends?**  

They are powerful, have lots of money and they are already changing. So while they may be giants, I do not see them as moving slowly. As a startup, however, we need to move faster.  

**You showed the ET Preview concept sedan at the Shanghai auto show in April. When will this Tesla Model 3 rival debut?**  

That was just to show the car's styling. We will gather the feedback and then decide when and how to launch a sedan in that segment.

**What's next for Nio?**  

We have started delivering the ES6 SUV that competes with the Audi Q5, BMW X3 and Mercedes GLC. Our performance is better, our service is better, maintenance and operating costs are lower and charging is much more affordable than filling up with gasoline. Not only that, the license plate is free [in Chinese cities such as Beijing the plate can cost more than the vehicle] and you don't need to leave it at home one day out of the workweek [to comply with driving restrictions in China to reduce air pollution].",2.0,2019-07-07 18:03:44,714.0

Against this backdrop, NIO is focusing on rolling out our ES6 nationwide, and at the same time, improving overall network utilization and operating efficiencies.‚Äù

We may see improvements on operating efficiencies in the next year which should improve gross margin.  

Also, the automobile market in China is highly cyclical, therefore we can expect Nio's best quarter to be Q4.  It's also the first quarter that Wall Street can compare Nio to it's past performance and estimate future growth.  Vehicle margin in Q4, 2018 was 3.7%.

"And therein lies the difference: Tesla had the right intangibles to scale at a rapid pace and cause investors to overlook its financial shortcomings.

A true visionary CEO people hailed and wanted to support; a car that at the time offered cutting edge technology, appealed to the social responsibility of consumers for adopting a zero emissions vehicle.

By the time the model S came out, there was MAJOR pent up demand.  Thousands of people sent deposits a year in advance, people waited.  It was cool to have one.

None of these things are true for Nio‚Äôs story.  I‚Äôm sorry to break that to you.  The CEO is not cut from the same cloth as Elon.  Nio is copying other companies and not innovating.  Nio isn‚Äôt even a factor in Level 5 autonomy.  It‚Äôs technology is well behind Tesla and other players who have already amassed real world autonomous driving miles.  They have no moat in a hyper-competitive space.  All they really did is burn a ton in SG&A and costs related to their NIO houses. It hasn‚Äôt gotten them anywhere.

I‚Äôll say it again for you.  **THERE IS NO DEMAND FOR NIO VEHICLES**.  They will never have their own factory because they will never be selling 100k+ cars a year.  They are struggling to hit 3000 deliveries per quarter of the ES8.  If they sell 50% more ES6 vehicles than ES8, but at the same time ES6 sales cannibalize 20% of ES8 sales, you are left with approximately 7000 cars sold in a quarter.

That‚Äôs maybe 28000 in a year, which would be impressive for them but in no way can move the needle whatsoever. That will cap them at about 1.2-1.5 billion in revenue for a year.  Of which they are probably lucky to see 10-15% of that in margin.

They are done, like I said look at their cash burn.  Who is going to keep throwing money at this?  They will at least need another dilutive offering, or to take on massive debt that will cost them a ton of money.

If you are holding you are betting on at least one of these things occurring:

- a surge in demand, which as of now looks highly unlikely given that at best they can hope for about 7000 cars delivered per quarter.

- massive help from the Chinese government, which as of now has not done a thing to truly help them out (in fact the lifting of EV subsidies hurt them)",0.0,2019-06-06 12:10:10,726.0

I personally think Nio will do great. It will do great once the ‚Äútrade war‚Äù is over in my estimate. Only reason the decline started was because of the tariffs place I personally think now is the best time to jump in!,5.0,2018-09-28 13:02:48,780.0
It‚Äôs early to tell but I think that it has great potential and it could do extremely well. That being said they have a lot of improvements to make not to mention we don‚Äôt know how long these cars will last if batteries fail (catch fire) or electrical problems start to happen it‚Äôs all over,2.0,2018-11-07 14:10:33,780.0

Within the first two days the price more than doubled which was awesome. The only reason that it fell to $9 and is sitting around there is because of the tariffs. I definitely think once the whole ‚ÄúTrade War‚Äù is over this stock will jump.
