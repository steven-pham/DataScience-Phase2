NIO needs neither Europe nor US to grow but Tesla won’t survive without China !,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/iuh8lo/nio_needs_neither_europe_nor_us_to_grow_but_tesla/," As I am investing in NIO, I read most of bullish and bearish articles on it. I must say, that I didn’t find so far any bearish analysis that would make sense to me. All bearish analysts use kind of misleading analogy trying to impose their opinion. The only risk i found, is that NIO is a Chinese company and the stock is highly manipulated, but even this will diminish by strong fundamentals.  
China is the market for EVs, in 2030 half of the vehicles must be NEV (around 20 millions).

Nio Stock Analysis and Predictions [September] - Why Nio Stock Is Up Today,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/iuwpxi/nio_stock_analysis_and_predictions_september_why/,,0,2020-09-18 13:25:53,7
"Confirmation of 6,000 NIO Vehicle Capacity",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/iu0xbo/confirmation_of_6000_nio_vehicle_capacity/,"In an earlier post I had suggested the increase from 15 jobs per hour to 20 jobs per hour suggested that NIO was producing 20 Vehicles Per Hour. Today's cntech article confirms those Vehicle Production numbers

[https://cntechpost.com/2020/09/16/nios-factory-boasts-up-to-97-5-automation-rate/](https://cntechpost.com/2020/09/16/nios-factory-boasts-up-to-97-5-automation-rate/)

The 5000 Rate quoted by NIO is consistent with the new CFO policy to Under Promise & Over Deliver

The NIO JAC operation requires only 12 workers on the assembly line with 97.5% automation 

Based on these numbers NIO Capacity in September seems to be 6,000. With Double Shift that can take NIO Vehicle Capacity to 150,000 in a full year once NIO has the Orders

Also with so few workers with 307 Robots doing most of the work the potential to move quickly to double shift seems easily possible once NIO has the Vehicle Orders plus Supply Chain Logistics worked out

So getting Orders is the challenge for NIO. With new EC6 Vehicles having as much as a 3 month wait time plus Record High Monthly Order Growth for both July & August it seems that NIO is performing Par Excellence on the Order Front. 

With NIO being the only Luxury EV company getting 18k RMB subsidy, Much Lower Entry Point with Baas, Local Company advantages over Tesla, Audi, Mercedes & BMW, pffering a 5 Star Life Style Experience NOT just an EV all point to Exciting Times ahead. Do your own DD",65,2020-09-17 06:05:14,8

"Surely One Job Per Hour Equals One Vehicle Produced Per Hour Meaning Production Capacity in September will be 6,000 meaning a Blow Out Quarter",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/ip6m53/surely_one_job_per_hour_equals_one_vehicle/,"Recently NIO Management stated they had increased Jobs per Hour from 15 to 20 on the NIO Assembly Line. At 15 Jobs Per Hour multiplied by 10 Hour Shift multiplied by 30 days you get 4500 Vehicle Capacity which is pretty close to prior Vehicle Production Capacity. So I am pretty sure One Job Per Hour equals One Vehicle Per Hour Produced.

Management also stated that they could increase Production to 150,000 with a double shift & without any significant investment.

20 Jobs Per Hour x 10 Hour Shift x 2 Shifts x 365 days Equals 146,000 Vehicles

Which is pretty much the same as the 150,000 NIO Management Stated they could produce

I have already made a Post suggesting August Orders may have been 8,000 based on Record Monthly Order Growth stated by NIO for BOTH July & August

So based on NIO Assembly Line producing 200 cars daily based on 20 Jobs Per Hour for 10 Hours

The Actual Potential Vehicle Production Capacity in September may be 6,000

The 5,000 Figure quoted by NIO is consistent with the new CFO Under Promising & Over delivering which has regularly happened in past 3-4 months -- Of course the right approach

Interestingly I am of the opinion that there must have been a few EC6 Veihcles Produced in August in anticipation of the September Launch so actual Vehicles produced were more than the stated 39

So the actual numbers delivered in September may be more BUT that number will also be reduced by EC6 Vehicles used at NIO Houses & Spaces for Showroom purposes

Using a 6,000 Vehicle Delivery Number for September gives 13,500 Vehicles delivered in Q3 -- A blow out quarter. Nasdaq may collapse, TSLA may collapse but Long Term NIO shareholders are sitting pretty in my opinion. I am not an expert. Do your own DD. Would welcome any comments on my logic especially from people with familiar with EV Assembly Line Jargon to confirm One Job Per Hour does mean One Vehicle Per Hour",15,2020-09-09 13:28:36,40

8000 New NIO Vehicle Orders Estimated for August 2020 -- Here is how & why,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/inpdhr/8000_new_nio_vehicle_orders_estimated_for_august/,"NIO Vehicle Deliveries 2020 (to nearest hundred)

Jan 1600; F 700; M 1500; A 3200; M 3400; J 3700; J 3500; A 4000

Absent information from company let us estimate Orders to be following month deliveries. That may be reasonable as long as Orders are below Production Capacity. For June 2020 we ADD 700 for ""strong demand"" of ES6 & ES8 per William Li, 5 day factory shutdown, flood issues. So estimated Orders for 2020:

Jan 700; F 1500; M 3200; A 3400; M 3700; J 4200

We can arrive at Monthly Order Growth by deducting Prior Monthly Orders from Current Monthly Orders. So 2020 Monthly Order Growth is:

Jan Negative due to Chinese New Year; F 800; M 1700; A 200; M 300; J 500

NOTE From October 2018 to November 2018 there was increase in deliveries from 1600 to 3100. So that may have been another period of very high Monthly Order Growth. 

For the first time ever Company talked of Record Monthly Order Growth in July 2020 & then again in August 2020. 

So let us say Order Growth in July was 1800 just a 100 more than 1700 figure we estimated for March 2020. July 24th was also start of taking EC6 Orders

Then we have 4200 for June Plus 1800 (Order Growth NIO referred to) equal to 6000 Orders in July 2020.

Now for August Company again talked of Record Monthly Order Growth. So let us estimate Order Growth in August was 2000 which may be reasonable due to taking full months new Orders for EC6.

Then for August we have 6000 for July 2020 plus 2000 equal to 8000 Orders in August 2020

Marketing 3 Models NOT 2, Much lower entry point to luxury EV courtesy Battery Program, Suning Partnership, Expiring Free unlimited Battery Swap Program, Higher Vehicle Parc leading to Higher Customer referrals which represent 45% of Sales; Expansion of Age Group Appeal for NIO Cars from 50 plus to 30 plus with introduction of EC6, RMB 18,000 subsidy are all powerful reasons backing the Estimated August 8,000 Order Numbers. No reason why the momentum should not continue into the seasonally strong Q4

Let us also talk of Q3 there are arguments to make for Deliveries in September being MORE than 5,000 as new CFO has record of under promising & in August NIO must have been producing EC6 vehicles in anticipation of September EC6 Launch. But using just 5,000 we get 12,500 Vehicle Deliveries in Q3 which blows us well beyond the 11,500 high guidance for Vehicle Deliveries in Q3. 

Above suggests a move to Double Shift may be announced by Year End & NIO management may now be working on the Supply Chain issues to cater for a Double Shift. With $3 Billion Cash after recent Public Offering, NIO seems well poised for explosive growth. With a Double Shift NIO can be in a good Profit Situation a decade before TSLA achieved such status. Remember William Li stated that Company could move to 150,000 Annual Capacity & Double Shift without any significant Investment.

With Rebate you can buy a Luxury DOUBLE Motor NIO EV for approx. RMB 250,000 which is the current cost of many of the lower non luxury EVs -- The marketing appeal seems overwhelming

Nio is a great company...,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/imzbl8/nio_is_a_great_company/," It is so funny to witness this kind of selloffs over the over again. You think people they would learn from the experience, but it happens all over again every time! All people are not the long term investors or have the nerves to sustain pressure. There are people who might have bought this stock on margin, or someone told them to buy, or trying to trade, or those who keep setting stop losses at different levels, etc. As soon as there is a small down trend they get scared and push the sell button. There are a few who are also trying to outsmart the market and sell high and buy back at lower price. They get lucky a few times and make a few thousand $ and think they are the master traders! :-).... Folks, Nio is a growing company. Just look at what they have going for them:  
1- Beautiful high quality car models that have won multiple awards, ...and new models keep coming out  
2- Production volume is going up month over month, and worldwide expansion of business world is being set for as early as next year  
3- It has good financial backing (this was not the case last year)  
4- They have multiple revenue generating businesses (e.g., BaaS, etc.)  
5- As it has been said, Nio is not just a car company. People they feel they are part of a bigger community  
6- Large number of patents, e.g., wireless charging, etc.  
7- Knowledgeable management  
8- and many more.....  
If this company had issues with any of the above criteria, I could have possibly convinced myself to get nervous during selloffs, but this is not the case and Nio is a great company....  
Having said this, we will see the same behavior like today over and over again :-) The real winners are the long term investors who don't get rattled easily, relaxed during these tumultuous times, and at the end they come out rich and happy :-)... keep loading up every time the opportunity presents itself.",35,2020-09-05 23:06:16,54

I have a conservative estimate of 4300 deliveries (3500(last month's deliveries)\*1.25). This assumes no growth, only production working the whole month.

"Google translate on some Chinese source, Weilai is NIO's name in Chinese",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/ij11hh/google_translate_on_some_chinese_source_weilai_is/,"Weilai stake to China increased by 10.5%, revenues increased by 10.5%! In the second quarter, Weilai sold 10,331 vehicles, with an average unit price of 450,000 and total revenue of 4.65 billion, but it was only 46.5\*0.749=3.5 billion on Weilai’s account. After the 10.5% equity redemption, the total revenue in China in the third quarter will increase by 10.5% out of thin air. According to 12,000 vehicles, the average unit price is 450,000, and the gross income from selling cars is 1.2\*45\*0.864=4.666 billion! And because the redemption price difference per share is 17 US dollars \* 40 million US dollars = 680 million US dollars \* 0.915 = 620 million US dollars = 4.28 billion yuan, the one-time financial net income is 4.28 billion yuan (after deducting the share capital and 8.5% interest expenses to Hefei )! After the third quarter earnings report, the stock price stood above $30! Genius, Li Bin, Feng Wei! Generous Hefei SASAC! Win three!

nasdaq: Another roughly $357 million will be used to buy out some of the shareholders in NIO China, which will give NIO ""up to an additional 8.6%"" of NIO China. 

[Weilai](https://xueqiu.com/S/NIO?from=status_stock_match) holds 75.9% of Weilai China, which accounts for about 85% of Weilai’s total assets. The number of shares corresponding to Weilai’s total assets is 1.375 billion shares, so each share of Weilai China is equivalent to Weilai’s shares: 13.75\* 0.85/0.759

Then the redemption of 8.6% is equivalent to 13.75\*0.85/0.759\*0.086=13242 million shares, the redemption price per share is 3.57/1.3242=2.7 US dollars, and the financing price per share is 19.86 US dollars, excluding financing expenses and other undisclosed item [Wei to](https://xueqiu.com/S/NIO?from=status_stock_match) finance the redemption price difference is 17.16 yuan per share, equivalent to one-time total earnings = 1.3242 \* 17.16 = US $ 2.272 billion, the actual cash income: US $ 0.75 \* 19.86-3.57 = 1132500000, Hefei interest earned minus 70 / 6.89\*0.086/0.241\*0.085=0.308 billion USD, net gain: 1.1 billion USD.

It is worth noting that: on the surface, the increase of shares by 75 million shares is actually a decrease of 1.3242-0.75 = 574.2 million shares. In other words: the capital increased by 1.1 billion US dollars and the number of shares decreased by 54.72 million shares!

The second part of the capital increase is to purchase an additional 1.9% of [Weilai](https://xueqiu.com/S/NIO?from=status_stock_match) China’s shares for US$600 million , and complete the capital injection requirements for the last transaction with Hefei: 1) Assume that the share price of Weilai China is the same as the redemption price. 2.7 US dollars, then its capital increase is 13.75\*0.85/0.759\*0.019\*2.7=0.79 billion US dollars. 2) So US$521 million will be used to complete the last investment agreement with Weilai China in Hefei. Information found on the Weilai website: NIO has also injected its cash investment of RMB1.278 billion for the first installment and RMB1.278 billion for the second installment and is fulfilling its other obligations, including injecting the Asset Consideration into NIO Anhui, in accordance with The definitive agreements. Weilai has injected a total of 2.556 billion yuan, and the total contract capital injection is 4.26 billion. Therefore, (42.6-25.56)/6.89=241 million US dollars of the 521 million US dollars were used to complete the last investment agreement with Hefei. Then the remaining US$280 million was used to redeem several debt-for-equity swaps issued at the beginning of the year. It's good again!

Up to about $600 million will go to exercise a provision in the investment agreements that will give it an additional 1.9% stake in NIO China. That cash will go into NIO China, and can be used for NIO's research and development, expanding its sales and service network, and other purposes related to its business in China.

After several transactions, [Weilai](https://xueqiu.com/S/NIO?from=status_stock_match) will hold 86.4% of Weilai China, approximately US$600 million will be used for Weilai’s research and development in China, and US$500 million will be used for Weilai’s global expansion. At the same time, it is equivalent to reducing the number of shares of Weilai by 54.72 million shares, and repaying several debt-to-equity debt (about 400 million US dollars), reducing the dilution of future debt-to-equity swaps.

In the next step, [NIO](https://xueqiu.com/S/NIO?from=status_stock_match) must do its best to complete the research and development of vehicle software and hardware, and the improvement of ADAS software and hardware. Refer to the management recommendation of I and BaaS, the car-machine system sees one step to increase the high-speed cruising range, increase the extreme high-speed, and reduce the time of 100 meters. ten thousand years is too long, fight for now!",10,2020-08-30 09:55:04,100

Could Nio be trusted?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/ihzkle/could_nio_be_trusted/,"Morning everyone, I have been following Nio for a while but have not bought any shares but still contemplating on the matter, reason being this company is in China and I am not the most fond of how some companies lie about their fundamentals, what makes people think that Nio would not be doing this down the line? 

Large funds and investors are adverse to investing in NIO is because its headquarters are based in Shanghai.
 This allows the company to post its accounts without needing to be verified by established auditors. It is also not illegal in China to post misleading accounts to foreign investors, thus, meaning there are no reprocussions deterring companies from doing this. To get back to my point, established funds and investors have now realised this is common practice as they have previously been stung by fraudulent companies based in China doing just this. This is the reason large funds are more bullish on Tesla than NIO. Hence, why its price is increasing at a faster rate.

Would like anyone's insight on this, so I can put my head to rest and purchase some Nio stocks when it dips back down.

Thank you for reading!",2,2020-08-28 15:17:57,109

Should I buy more?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/ih2uke/should_i_buy_more/,"Need advice guys. So I started investing about a month ago, and the first stock I brought was Nio lol. I brought high when it hit around 14$  and quickly learned the lesson not to buy high. I road the wave and was about to sell when it hit 11$, thank god I didn’t . 

I currently have 25 shares, should have brought more sadly. Now I want to buy another 25 shares but the price is high now atm. 

I plan to hold long term and think it can reach 100$ by next year. 

What would be a good price to get in again? I know nio might go down again around 18/17 but what if it doesn’t especially with car sales coming up.

[Chinese] Some thoughts on BaaS and Q&A with CEO Li Bin.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/ig6rer/chinese_some_thoughts_on_baas_and_qa_with_ceo_li/,"Copied from Nio App. Some thoughts on BaaS and Q&A with CEO Li Bin. Kindly Google translate if you can’t read Chinese ><

李斌解读 BaaS (Thoughts)

1.用户有得选，很重要 
「我们不指望用户马上接受，毕竟我们内部都讨论了 5 年」，李斌开场时这样说。

李斌认为 BaaS 之于蔚来用户，就像蔚来本身的可充可换补能。 

「打个比方，这就像你普通的考试已经是学霸了，往上还有奥数之类的比赛。你有的选，这很重要，和别的电动车品牌比很重要。这样想就很简单，（BaaS）是个 option 。」 

李斌认为，蔚来出台政策的时候，没伤害老用户就好办。「老用户没吃亏，新用户多了个选择 」。 

2. BaaS 本质上不是金融方案 

「要不要 BaaS，根据你自己的资金状况去选」。 

李斌昨晚说，2018 年蔚来推电池租用方案，立减 10 万的时候，「我们其实就是拿自己的资本金去搞的。那种不能贷款情况下，还有很多的用户去选」。

「Baas 对我来说就像是谈恋爱，暗恋了三年，恋爱了 5 年，现在终于官宣了。它对我意义非常大，大家千万别理解成金融方案，这样就理解得太小了，这是商业体系的创新」。 

李斌还说，昨天已经有很多用户选了 BaaS。至于有些用户讨论很激烈，「那因为你已经是电动车用户了，但电动车用户比例非常小，所以视角不一样。」
3. BaaS 是讲给汽油车主听的 

「BaaS 这个故事是讲给沉迷在汽油车幻想的用户听的，因为对他们来说，电池是跑得远才省钱，因为电费比油费便宜很多。但我跑的很少，一个月五百公里，那我没油费啊。」 

李斌认为传统的算法讲不清楚，「而且换电池就要很多钱，还有电池衰减怎么办，以后二手交易怎么办？不把时间维度放长，你就没法算清楚，这是一个总体的事情。」 

「比如说买个 X3 一个月开两三千公里，一千多块油费是要的。三四十万的中级车，堵车多一点就要花一千四五百块钱，这还是油价掉下来的情况。油车开一百年就要给一百年油费，这就是能源补充费用。蔚来有家用充，加上免费换电，6 次也够了。」

「服务费和油费比很公平啊，就算油车 1200 我们 1000，那也省了 200。而且蔚来用户开的普遍多一点，一般开两三万公里，在座的用户你们想想是不是比以前开的多了？」 

图片来自用户 @jerryd 
4. 这套逻辑可以把汽油车车主转换过来 

李斌昨晚继续拿宝马 X3 做例子。 

「X3 39 万，那 ES6 减掉 7 万直接就比他便宜了，还有购置税。做贷款也划算，汽油车一般都是 30% 首付，电车可以做到 15%。」

「然后每个月油费起码少两百块，上牌不用钱，买车省十几万，然后月供也少，每个月少付 1800，上海送牌照北京不限行，这没法算了是吧？」

李斌认为大家不用纠结到底是哪个划算，蔚来的当务之急，是用这个逻辑赶紧把汽油车用户转换过来，告诉更多的汽油车用户。 

5. 蔚来打到了汽油车的痛处 

「昨天有人跟我说，有很多不知道哪来的水军，打着电车名义其实是汽油车用户，发了十几篇。BaaS 在我们 APP 里的讨论是有史以来最高的，比 NIO DAY 高多了，都不知道哪里来的。」 

李斌认为，这是油车企业觉得有危险了，「因为终于有人把账算明白了，汽油车行业知道他们的 bug 在哪里，他们觉得很麻烦了。」 

「把电费和油费去比，是他们最怕的事情，如果都用我们的方法，那电车其他地方就不会比汽油车差了。电池加上电，才是和油匹配的。其他车企思维方式不同，就只能用传统的方式去和汽油车比。」

6. 「传统」的电动汽车有「bug」？ 

「特斯拉最近在说一百多万英里的电池，那现在的用户怎么办？为什么今天提这个？因为 12 年的 S 已经 8 年了，那一批用户不多，所以现在不显现，可是现在的用户 6 年后怎么办呢？」 

「电池包的寿命低于整车的寿命，最近特斯拉老说长寿命电池，因为他们知道这个 bug 开始暴露了。8 年前的电池剩下 70%，蔚来如果给你换一块 70% 的 70 度电池，会不会骂我？」 

「当然，有些人跑的多有些人跑的少。有些蔚来用户跑了十几万公里，按照特斯拉的想法就得换电池了。我们就会把它慢慢的从里面退出来，这是个体系的东西。」 


(Summary before Q&A)
李斌在问答环节开始之前总结道： 

「第一，老用户没吃亏；第二新用户多了选择，没想明白没关系，继续全款买；第三，主要是为了帮汽油车用户，用他最理解的思维算账。」 


BaaS Q&A 

Q1：感觉 980 甚至比油费贵，我一直认为电车可以给我省油费，那这个钱给我省了什么？ 

李斌：省了 7 万块，剩下的还能贷款啊，哈哈哈。 

其实不存在这个给我省了什么那个没省什么，总体上买肯定划算。要不前面少划算一点后面多划算一点，要不前面多划算一点后面少划算一点，反正都划算。 

前提的前提，是你得把 X3 和 ES6 用这个原始车价对比，否则你没法比了。你必须知道 ES6 这是一款好的车，轴距空间双电机加速空气悬挂等等，否则没法讲了。 

这不是个容易的事情，我们想了三年搞了五年，今年开了 21 次会的事情怎么会简单？

Q2：980 这个定价是怎么定的？ 

李斌：其实是经过了周密的测算，包括平均里程和油价的核算。如果是每个月只开一两次车的用户，那没办法了，这种你开一个汽油车也没用。开的越多的用户就越合算，四五千公里的用户合算大了。 

如果计算方法和里程绑在一起就复杂了，给大家创造复杂不是我们的目的。还要考虑几年内电池的成本、将来的电池成本下降，不然成天调价不行；还有整个运营体系的成本，因为我还要换的，还要周转电池，必须是一个可持续的方案；还有大家的心理感受。 

这个定价，是蔚来电池资产公司经营成本和用户利益综合到一块的结果，肯定是远低于一般汽车金融的资金成本去算，昨天有人说这是高利贷，肯定不是这个逻辑。

你觉得合算你就买，不合算就不买，给大家安心的选择。算来算去太辛苦，蔚来是负责算大帐，避免大家算小帐，开多少公里去算，多麻烦啊这事。我们讨论过各种版本，有一个是收一个基本费用，然后按里程算，这个太麻烦。 

肯定会有一些用户吃点亏，但总体上是比较划算的。

Q3：这个 980 的价格以后会变吗？ 

李斌：价格肯定不会一成不变，比如 2020 款 ES8 就比老款更贵了。 

我们做 980 的时候，就考虑了比较长时间内的电池成本。电池成本真的会更快下降吗？我今天还看不到这个点。今年以来成本下降的幅度大大降低了，我们在可见将来不会考虑这个事。更长的话会考虑，但现在太早了。 

Q4：相比电租方案，980 是不是亏了？ 

李斌：我们原来的方案是个金融方案，选了就不能贷款了。前面那个付的挺多的， 我们觉得和 BaaS会相冲。原来首付低了，是因为我们贴了息的，这个以后肯定不会再有，即使没有 BaaS 也不会有。 

原来的方案差不多要停了，如果没有 BaaS 的话年初就要停了。减 10 万的方案有的人觉得划算，有的觉得不划算，因为对初始资金要求比较高。 

这属于蔚来提供的免费午餐，坚持到现在很不容易了，贴了四个多亿，我觉得就到这了，还加上免费换电。
之前的方案损失了三十多万资金的自由度，不划算的。另外 25 万干什么不好，对吧？ 

秦力洪：蔚来不会像某品牌，一下 100 万干到 30 万的，老车主的体验很差。我们 30 多万 40 多万车主群体差不多，车的标定价格没有变。大家不用特别担心这件事。
Q5：老车主可以加入 BaaS 吗？BaaS 车型以后二手交易也是要租电池？ 

李斌：不是我们不想，是有这个法规的约束，这是本质的原因。 

新的国家公告上面写着的换电车型，将来二手车流转的时候，买家就要 check 一下含不含电池。卖家你是有告知别人的义务的，不能把租的房子卖给别人。因为以前的车型没有标注，就很难做这个事情（加入 BaaS）。

Q6：BaaS 能不能买断？ 

李斌：大家不要理解成金融方案，不是一回事。我不明白你交了 980 之后，为什么要买断呢？ 

我跟你算残值那就不好玩了，你买了什么呢？你已经跑了 50 万公里了，那又怎么算呢？如果非得算的话，我可能还得找你要钱了。有的用户 6 年后跑了四五十万公里，那不就得找你要钱？ 

这没法算，这是服务费不是租赁。微软卖 SAS（Software as Service）也是这样的。 

把它和油去比是最合理的，简单是很重要的一个体验。它跟产权没关系，这是费，不是还款。车是消费品，电池是消耗品，这就相当于过去 6 年加了 12 万的油费 你突然说这个油你得给我吧？ 

秦力洪：6 年 7 万，其实是你以前少交的 7 万还了，就像房子 1000 万首付 500 万，那不是降价 500 万。上来少给了 7 万，中间也要算资金成本，而且到底用了多少年等于买了那块 70 度电池？电池成本也会变。 

当然，服务费超过 1000 肯定不好，这是斌哥的要求。不要四位数，给电池资产留一些利润空间。
Q7：BaaS 方案的保险怎么算？ 

李斌：我们提到的，没有服务无忧的话再收 80，是因为 BaaS 用户车险也是不含 7 万交的。但是肯定还得保这个电池，所以非服务无忧的话就得另外给保费。 

秦力洪：保障的对象没有变，只是付费的方式变了，交易方式变了。 
Q8：不开车也要给钱吗？想退出 BaaS 怎么办？ 

李斌：不开车也要考虑电池本身的闲置成本，相当于我们多了一个电池出来。 

本身长期不用那个车的话，我们开发了专门保护车辆的东西，把它搞好了，拉回去，应该是现场做好拉回去，签协议的时候会告诉用户。 

我们会收一个拆电池保护车子的费用，大概是 1500 块，还有 3 个月的保管费用。5 个月以上（不用车）的话，找我们划算的，3 个月以内就不太划算。 

大方向来讲，选 BaaS 的用户要想好,以后就是没有买断的。电池当成一个费用，不要当成产权。他这是概念的区别，选了的用户就不能有买断的概念了，这是两条路。不能什么好处都拿了，规则就是这样。 

秦力洪：对电池产权有要求的朋友请不要选 BaaS，他是另外一个世界的东西，大家也不用紧张。 

这里我想说一下，很多朋友在 APP 里面说了，有关方面组织水军来我们这里留言。几十上百个人，没有头像没有签名，发言一模一样。搞得像是斌哥想了一个什么把韭菜给割了，其实免租这个早就该取消了，是斌哥在坚持。 

Q9：BaaS 对以后二手交易保值率会有什么影响？ 

李斌：BaaS 对保值率是有好处的，当然现在蔚来品牌车龄比较短。但是总体上来说，肯定是让我们的车长期来讲保值率更高。（BaaS）是很灵活，更便宜的方式保证使用。 

至于买断电池的总残值不会更低的，因为它带电池的。 

二手车保值率是非常体系的，品牌越来越强，也就越来越保值。我们公司状态比一年前好多了，从蔚来的保值率来说，我们是非常有信心的。当然创始版用户还得考虑实际购车成本是多少是吧？补贴很多那时候。 

选了 BaaS 的用户，减掉 7 万他不用考虑电池的话，保值率肯定会高一些。没有的用户，蔚来肯定会保证流通电池状态的，所以也有信心。是蔚来在托底，保证电池健康状态良好。不管是买没买断，用户都得益。 

其他品牌电动二手车的用户，重新购买一块电池的压力今天感受不到的，几年后你就感受得到了。蔚来相当于有一个净化器，水库里面的水保持干净的。二手车以后我们会专门去说。
Q11：能不能回收车壳留着电池 再买个白车身？ 

李斌：回收车壳？那电池留着干嘛？这个倒是个新问题，我现在没想明白，回去要讨论一下。 

但我觉得不能把账算的这么清。这么算的话，你跑了多少公里？我一定会看公里数的。这是好的问题，但今天不着急回答。 

你已经跑了 30 万公里，还要求给你一块好电池，这就不公平，对这个体系不公平。每个人都挑最好的账来算，那这个体系就崩溃掉了。我要对池子里面所有电池的健康度保底。  

秦力洪：我们 BaaS 车有国家公告，但不可以下线一台车不带电池，不可以这么做。我们确实需要电池，这个可以讨论。但你捏着的电池产权，在体系里面是虚拟掉了的。 
Q12：当以后车辆报废的时候，到底是报废这台车 还是报废这块电池？ 

李斌：你用了这辆车 12 年，不代表你当初买的那块电池还活着。事实上好像电池还在，但是虚拟掉了的。 

当有一辆要 ES8 要报废，我们肯定是装一块也要报废了的电池一起报废掉，肯定不会给一块报废的 ES8 装上一个新的电池。我们的电池是逐步报废，逐步退役，不会有报废的车辆非要拉着一块电池陪葬，这种情况不合理。 
Q13：BaaS 推广到销售端有多少目标？怎么教育市场和用户？ 

李斌：BaaS 没有销售目标，这就是多了个选项，自然有人会喜欢，没有把别的选项取消掉。 

你可以相信我，这个比例一定会很快提高。蔚来做了很多别人很难理解的创新，比如当年没有建工厂。BaaS 并不是突发奇想做这个事情，可能还有很多细节没有严丝合缝想明白，但我们整个体系逻辑是很清楚的。  

秦力洪：昨天开完发布会下到牛屋一楼，一个大姐坐在那。Fellow 给她讲 BaaS，五分钟拿下，说哇省了这么多油钱。思想的沟通和理解是长时间的事情，斌哥也没想着今天说完大家就透彻了。 
Q14：想短租 100 度的用户费用怎么算？BaaS 短租可以吗,费用怎么定？ 

李斌：BaaS 用户和买断的都可以升级 100，价格都一样，不会说买断一个价 BaaS 一个价。我们没有必要差异化，也不会差异化。短租是当月服务费+短租租金，具体价格，是不是有更灵活的，以后会说。 

现在的目标肯定是先把 100 度交付，根据生产情况调度情况等等灵活升级。目前最大的还是换电站的问题，不是生产的问题。大家还是要给我们一点时间。 
Q15：排产了的现在有没有机会换成 BaaS？ 

李斌：已经排产了的，确实很抱歉没办法做，主要是出来的合格证不一样。 

排产了的话，打出来的合格证不带换电的，所以目前来讲没办法做这个事情，主要是政策法规的约束。 
Q16：二代换电站可不可以无人换电，24 小时服务？ 

李斌：二代已经在加快研发，最终目的肯定是无人值守，效率更高、成本更低、体验更好。 现在的技术条件，我们的车自动倒进去是可以的。但还是考虑一些安全因素，考虑到自动驾驶啊，至少不用下车啊这些，大家给一点时间。 

明年肯定会加快部署，我们 2017 年说的 2020 年底 1100 个，今年肯定没有了,但以后肯定会达到这个数的。明年争取一天部署一个换电站，大家有好的地方一定要跟我们说，让我们的同事把它锁下来。 
Q17：二代换电站的铺设重心是？蔚来会像特斯拉那样，毛利率上来之后降价吗？ 

李斌：换电站我们还是优先满足需求大、车主保有量大的地区，像长三角、珠三角、京津冀这些地方。成本的话，大概会降到现在的一半以下。我们合作的供应链企业有很多，但肯定是我们自己研发。 

蔚来会保证价格稳定，我们保证价格稳定是对用户负责，我们有能量应该去改进服务、改进产品。 

雷克萨斯从来不降价，卖的也挺好。为什么要老是降价呢？更不要说我们现在毛利率才刚刚转正。 

产品本身竞争力、服务的竞争力是第一位的。我们的逻辑是，使产品比其他车远要更值得这个价。我们现在和同价位汽油车电动车比，产品力都是更高的，那管降不降价干嘛呢？",4,2020-08-25 18:24:22,130

For those who're concern about NIO price movement... Frankly, I don't know... NIO CEO  already mentioned BaaS during earnings report, and they are only releasing the details on the 20th. The only thing that I can confirm is high volatility, something NIO stock don't seem to lack.

If you want me to guess, I'll wager on good news... Li Bin always gives out good news asap, while bad news are always delayed as long as possible.",33,2020-08-18 12:29:45,149

As both NIO and this subreddit grow, the need for new rules and moderation has increased. As such, I'm currently working on creating new comprehensive guidelines for contributors. This includes post requirements, removal of non-contributing posts, and ensuring ever member contributes to a welcoming and informative community.

A few weeks ago I tested daily investor discussion threads. We are going to start those back again starting tomorrow and will continue every weekday. I am also adding a weekly investor discussion thread, which will be posted every Sunday. Please use these threads for all daily discussions related to NIO stock.

I am very excited to welcome our first new moderator, u/Blasprilla3, and will continue to search for additional moderators.

Stop setting short term expectations,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/i8g07c/stop_setting_short_term_expectations/,"I said this in a comment in this subreddit and I’ll say it in a post so more can hear it:

Stop setting short term expectations. Have better quality in your posts, not “I HOPE STOCK STOCK REACHES (price) TODAY”. Then if it doesn’t every post in the subreddit is going to be “what happened? Why didn’t it reach (price) today?”

Learn to set long term expectations. You can’t predict what happens in the short term. If you want to predict short term fluctuations go to the day trader sub.

Additionally, join r/nioglobal for a more actively moderated sub if you want higher quality posts as it will hopefully be higher moderated (if we find more mods) and you won’t see low quality posts. The original moderator made me a mod but the sub is looking for multiple mods. If you have mod experience/have reason to want to be a mod just message him or me

EDIT:

to be clear, this is not an attempt to poach the sub, I don’t give a fuck about being moderator but I’m for having a better community and better moderation. Many have reached out to the mod in this sub about having more mods since nothing is really being done against low quality posts. He does not respond to them so it is to be assumed that there will continue to be low quality posts in this sub. This is simply an alternative solution to the problem in which I am happy to discuss.",48,2020-08-13 03:41:49,161
What I learned from Q2 Report & CC,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/i8lod1/what_i_learned_from_q2_report_cc/,"NIO can increase annual capacity to 150,000 with little significant investment

Clear mention of the potential & feasibility of a second shift at JAC

August delivery number will be lower than possible because there will be EC6 production in August in anticipation of September launch & sales meaning September numbers may be higher than production

Going to increase production rate at Hefei from 15 jobs per hour to 20 jobs per hour

All ducks in a row with Govt Approvals to sell Battery & EV separately. So we are entering the Luxury EV at RMB 258,000 minus battery courtesy of NIO

Very big ES8 Order backlog at the moment

Significant pressure on delivery & production in Q4 (Blockbuster Q4?)

Analysis on what’s happened,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/i7xww9/analysis_on_whats_happened/,"So I’m sure a lot of you (me included) are a bit hurt, confused by the stock results associated with a record breaking earnings. For anyone looking for answers as to why the price fell so hard this should provide some insight to the situation. 

For people like you and me, NIO is a hardworking and innovative EV company. It’s faced it’s hardship honestly and instead of giving up, opened itself up to new possibilities and investment which in turn have positively encouraged its plan to progress into the EV market.

However, to everyone else who has not followed NIO from the start, it’s just another Chinese startup with negative financials, big promises and big ambition. It faced near bankruptcy in Q1 only publish a record breaking, unaudited positive margin in Q2.. to them, suspicious right?

Sounds harsh but this is the facts, so does this mean NIO is not worth dirt on ours shoes? No, we know the value of NIO because we have seen it work so hard to turn the problems around, with strong delivery reports every month. Then to see all that work turn into a Quarterly report as good as this, we know it’s only up from here. But, because the majority of people have the second view of NIO, it means they have to work twice as hard to see a reflection in the share price. 

NIO has a history of rising strong, sometimes unexpectedly, but it will rise that’s the key to take from this.

Edit: short sellers probably sold too quickly taking early profits which caused an avalanche sell off which discouraged people even looking into NIO.",19,2020-08-12 07:07:58,172

NIO announced they will deliver between 11,000 and 11,500 vehicles in Quarter 3 of this year. This adjusts to 4,000 to 4,250 vehicles per month.

NIO announces a positive cash flow for the first time in NIO's history.

A bulk of the company's loss comes from R&D which has been spent on investments to ensure NIO's prolonged success and innovation both technologically and situationally.

NIO's increased investment in Autonomous technology is to be fully autonomous and industry leading, reaching level 4 autonomy with more data and experience than competitors.

The EC6 will be priced at $52,987, and pre-orders are performing better than previously expected with mass demand. Deliveries are to begin in late December.

NIO plans on increasing their delivery output to 5,000 cars per month by late August.

NIO is proud to announce an additional 22 new NIO houses, 189 new NIO houses, and 143 new NIO charging stations.

NIO announced profound progress with their BaaS sector, completing criteria and certifications to officially divide the companies.

NIO's CEO Li Bin regarded the progress the BaaS sector of NIO has had a ""breakthrough moment"".

NIO plans to expand to the European, Israeli, and Australian markets, but not until NIO has captured a larger market in China.

Trump Administration Seeks to Delist U.S.-Listed Chinese Companies for Blocking Audit Inspections,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/i7o9bb/trump_administration_seeks_to_delist_uslisted/,"The Donald Trump administration issued a set of recommendations intended to address the long-running inability of the U.S. audit regulator—the PCAOB—to inspect accounting firms based in China whose audit clients are listed in U.S. stock markets. One plan would toughen listing standards on U.S. stock exchanges for what the administration calls non-cooperating jurisdictions (NCJs). But this really targets China as other countries have agreements with the PCAOB.

For Chinese companies—such as tech giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu, Inc.—that want to continue with their listing or want to initiate listing on a U.S. exchange, the PCAOB must have access to audit work papers of the principal audit firm. Companies that cannot grant access because of government restrictions can satisfy this standard by providing a co-audit from an accounting firm “with comparable resources and experience” that the PCAOB determined can conduct proper exams.

The new listing standard gives a transition period until January 1, 2022, for already listed companies. The new standards will be immediately applied to new listings after rulemakings become effective.

Details of the recommendations are in a July 24, 2020, report drafted by the President’s Working Group (PWG) on Financial Markets. PWG is chaired by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, and he made the report public on August 6. This responds to a June 4 memorandum by President Trump directing the PWG to come up with plans to address the problem.

"Biigest reason, that no one mentions, why NIO may rise shortly & rapidly to $20 is the 201 million new Shorts over past 2 weeks which is 26.22% of total volume.

Over the past 2 weeks a further 201.101 million have been shorted. Link below details that

 [https://fintel.io/ss/us/nio](https://fintel.io/ss/us/nio) 

Of course we do not know how many shorts covered in the past 2 weeks. A good indication of that will come out on August 11th when latest NIO Short Position is reported. The 201 million new Shorts represents a large 26.22% of the total volume. So with the new Shorts in NIO plus some old shorts covering, the Shorts may account for a big 50% of the total volume. One thing is certain the Shorts have lost huge money in the NIO Stock in the same manner they lost hundreds of million of dollars in the Tesla Stock. Perhaps losses so far for NIO Shorts may be over $800 million. For sure Ma Huateng, the richest man in China & NIO largest shareholder will be well aware of the huge NIO Short position & just like Elon Musk in Tesla, have no love for the NIO Shorts. 

Of the approx 900 million shares NIO float, over half that float would be owned by Ma Huateng Tencent Institutions & Mutual Funds. The NIO Shorts have artificially inflated that Float by their shorting. On good earnings news with good detail on Sales, Gross Profit Margin, Orders, Production Capacity you may possibly have both new Longs plus less new Shorts which could be a powerful combination for an explosive move upwards -- both longs & shorts buying with an absence of sellers! When keeping a stock down, the shorts act together. When the game is lost the Shorts act selfishly to cover before their fellow Shorts. Similar action by the Tesla shorts was arguably the single biggest reason for the Tesla stock rising from $250 to $1500 in a few months. The NIO Shorts could similarly be a main driver for the NIO Stock rising from current $13.42 share price to the $20 range if the earnings are upbeat on Sales, Production Capacity, Future Outlook & Gross Profit Margin. Also on the down days there has been relatively low volume in NIO stock indicating an absence of sellers -- which is more bad news for the NIO Shorts.

I'm thinking Nio is very undervalued because Nio just announced that they expect to continue delivering ~3500 vehicles per month.  Using Tesla as a precedent, when Tesla was delivering that same # of cars, their stock price was over $100 while Nio's is hovering around $13.  True, chinese quality may be different and Nio doesn't own their own factory, AND the company is largely owned by outside investors (especially w the COVID bailout), but I still think it's undervalued.",10,2020-08-08 06:43:36,209

Can both TSLA & NIO Business Models prosper equally in the EV market,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/hywo9f/can_both_tsla_nio_business_models_prosper_equally/,"NIO is committed to Dual Motor EVs that provide Batteries that can be rented, leased, swapped & upgraded. In recent interview Li Bin stated: In the short term, NIO has just crossed the life and death line.

 [https://cntechpost.com/2020/07/26/nio-is-planning-to-enter-global-markets-including-us/](https://cntechpost.com/2020/07/26/nio-is-planning-to-enter-global-markets-including-us/) 

EV Battery Costs have gone down from $1100 per in 2010 to approx. $135 per kwh in 2020. These Per kwh costs are expected to go down another 50% in next 10 years.

Cutting edge EV Batteries have risen in capacity from 50 kwh & lower to currently 100 kwh

So we have a situation that many may prefer & find it more economical to rent a battery in the knowledge that 2 years later they will be able to rent a higher capacity battery at a lower cost.

Of course those that buy EV Vehicles with dedicated batteries will not have that option. So it seems to me that NIO & TSLA have embarked on ""collision course"" business models. The $64 question is Can both business models survive thrive & prosper in the Chinese & other global markets or will one ultimately dominate the other.

""The U.S. government accused two hackers in China of targeting U.S. firms involved in coronavirus research, in a wide-ranging indictment that alleged the pair also stole hundreds of millions of dollars in sensitive information from companies around the world while working on behalf of Beijing’s premier spy service.""

Today, it got worse and the US decided to force the Chinese Consulate in Houston to close down its Consulate.

What's really fascinating is the fire that broke out in the outdoor courtyard area where documents are burned by the Chinese Consulate. Probably an overreaction in uncertain times where they cannot be sure if the US will violate the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which states that diplomatic bags aren’t supposed to be opened or detained by host countries. Or maybe they do have some incriminating evidence?

For NIO and JAC,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/huguj0/for_nio_and_jac/,"For NIO:
- Their current contract with JAC is a strategy to bootstrap upon their manufacturing capabilities. The supply chain climate in China is different from USA (which is why TSLA is so insistent on Gigafactory in US). This is also why super profitable companies like Apple use Foxconn instead of making their own factories. Infact, JAC is considered very vertically integrated compared to traditional automakers.
- Scaling up rapidly at the cost of manageable negative gross margins is a strategy to quickly reach economies of scale, wright's law, and reap network effects. The more cars there are on the streets, the more peer-selling, and more data collection for their self driving tech.
- Everything in China needs Guanxi. Business use Guanxi to get funds, people use Guanxi to get others to support products, etc. 
- The CEO of NIO has very good Guanxi. Basically, after meeting with the Tencent CEO, the question was ""How much money do you need? You better make this successful or I will kill you."" The only rich guy in China that he couldn't get Guanxi with was Jack Ma.
- NIO home is an extension of the Guanxi thing. Buyers of NIO are upper-middle class and they can use it as a way to get new contacts.",17,2020-07-20 19:07:29,302

1/3 of NIO stocks is owned by China's richest man : Ma Huateng,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/ht08qr/13_of_nio_stocks_is_owned_by_chinas_richest_man/,"If you're worried about the recent drop in prices for NIO, here's something to bolster up your faith. Link: [https://ir.nio.com/static-files/20342617-e950-4360-9bfe-dffec75ec5f0](https://ir.nio.com/static-files/20342617-e950-4360-9bfe-dffec75ec5f0)

At first glance, you see Tencent Holdings and 3 other unknown companies listed in this Schedule 13D, owning between 4-16% of the companies. Right, nothing interesting there.

However, if you scroll down to the bottom of the document, you notice something. All these companies are signed by Ma Huateng himself.

The real kicker is :

*Tencent is the parent company of Image Frame, Mount Putuo and Huang River and may be deemed to beneficially own the securities held of record by Image Frame, Mount Putuo and Huang River.*

When you add up all the ownership percentage of each company, it adds up to 34%.

Also, you see that Ma Huateng is a current deputy to the Fifth Shenzhen Municipal People’s Congress and servant of the 12th National People’s Congress. Very strong ties to the CCP and it's safe to say that the CCP will always be ready to inject more funds in NIO during its unprofitable growth years. Having a vote of confidence from China's richest man and CCP is enough reason for me to always hold on.

Car manufacturing has always been a capital intensive industry and profits will not come for many years. To put things in perspective, TSLA only became profitable in 2019 and that took 16 years!

NIO Options vs Short Selling,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/ht9q83/nio_options_vs_short_selling/," Just have a question as I am not understanding why my the profit seems to be similar for short selling vs buying put options.

I bought 15 Nov 20th 2020 $10 NIO Puts on July 13th for roughly $2.25 each when the price of NIO was roughly \~ 15.50 at the time.

Today they are worth roughly $2.90 when the price of NIO is at $11.00.

My price = 15 x $2.25 x 100 = $3375, today 15 x $2.90 x 100 = 4350. I am making roughly $975 atm.

If I were to short $3375 worth of shares at $15.50, I would be shorting about 217 shares.

At today's price, my profit would be ($15.50 - $11) x 217 = $976.5.

I know option pricing factor in a lot of things but in this scenario, I don't seem to be profiting much more from leverage. Why is this the case?",6,2020-07-18 15:19:30,320
NIO bear here. Prove me wrong.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/htar50/nio_bear_here_prove_me_wrong/,"My words may fall on deaf ears here but I thought I'd see if I can start a somewhat intellectual and civil conversation about the bull vs bear case for NIO, and why, after being a bull myself from Oct 2018-March 2019, I no longer believe NIO will be the dominant EV player many think they will be.  While I don't believe they will go under, I think there are many challenges that lie ahead, and extreme financial struggles will continue for the foreseeable future.

I accept that this post will attract lots of trolls and the downvotes that come with it.  So be it.  My goal here isn't to start online beef, but to see if investors with a current, long position can show me something I'm not seeing.  I admit I don't know everything, so enlighten me.

First, the bull case.

1. Quarterly deliveries are up 170% Q/Q and 190% Y/Y.  That's 10,331 deliveries Q2 2020 vs 3,838 Q1 2020.  This most certainly caught the street off-guard.
2. They continue to introduce attractive looking EV's that I believe have massive appeal.  I haven't seen anything from China that is even remotely close in the looks department, excluding Tesla.
3. China's auto market is by far the largest in the world.
4. Their only real competition in the luxury EV market is Tesla.  However, I'm not convinced they are a real threat to NIO.  Completely different price points, different demographic.  Maybe I'm wrong here.
5. They seem to have major government support as well as what seems like unlimited funding from tech giant Tencent.
6. Some potential for a robo-taxi fleet, albeit well down the road.

The bear case.

1. NIO is yet to be profitable and continues to burn through hundreds of millions every quarter ($-239m Q1 2020).  While I understand it's not likely an EV startup would be in a cash rich position at this stage, trading at a market cap of $13.1b when compared to profitable counterparts doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.
2. They are trading at an insane PS of 11.8 and 14 times its trailing 12 mth sales.  For reference, Tesla, with its nonsensical valuation is trading at a PS of 9.65 and 10.9 times its sales.  
3.  Their liabilities have ballooned to over $3.3b up from $2.99b last quarter.  Q1 Cash flow stands at $-320m.  Long term debt also continues to grow at an alarming rate. 
4.  Very real possibilities of further share dilution as they try to raise capital to cover losses and keep operations flowing. 
5. China's economic conditions will likely worsen into 2021 as nobody knows how long the global recession we're in will last.
6. Management seems to be fixated on the NIO lifestyle, spending hundreds of millions on ""NIO houses"" instead of focusing on vehicle production, innovation, and sales.
7. Weak branding.  Friends of mine in Shanghai have never even heard of NIO when I mentioned it, but every single one knew Tesla (mixed demographic).
8. And last and maybe the most important at least in the short term, the chart is looking mighty ugly for the longs.  Textbook popped bubble with a gap from $12 to $8 that is begging to be filled.  The downside momentum continues to be strong.

So what's your opinion and what am I missing?  Are you invested because you believe in the growth story or do you believe NIO is trading at a fair valuation?  **I'm interested in hearing facts, not your opinion that you think they have a bright future.**

And yes, I do have a short position.",3,2020-07-18 16:37:34,321

When you day-trade, you try to buy low and sell as high as possible in a day's time, possibly several times  within a day.
Investing is when you basically don't care about the stock's pricing point for months or years. When you've done your research in the field and in the stock and a calculated decision on purchasing, that means HOLDING and not selling whenever it goes up or down.

Article from 2016 about Tesla cash burn and what it could say about NIO.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/hm24oq/article_from_2016_about_tesla_cash_burn_and_what/,"[https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2016/10/26/tesla-looks-like-its-running-out-of-energy/#4b67c4444d51](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2016/10/26/tesla-looks-like-its-running-out-of-energy/#4b67c4444d51)

TSLA has always reported non-GAAP, and if you go by GAAP, by 2016, it had already incinerated $7.4B in losses.  The article I linked is from late 2016, when Tesla was selling around 26k units/quarter, and a year earlier had been selling around 11k units/quarter.  The reason I mention this is because of how much has been made of NIO's cash burn, but it may not be any worse than Tesla's at a similar point in their path to scale.  I also suspect that much of NIO's cash burn has been driven by the need to build out a battery swap infrastructure that can support the key feature of the vehicles in advance of scaling.  

Around that time (mid 2015), Tesla had a market cap of $30B, give or take - when it was producing 11k units/yr.  If we use that as a barometer for NIO, let's say that BECAUSE it's Chinese and there can be a lot of (perhaps warranted) skepticism around how Chinese firms conduct their accounting\*, it gets half the credit - see the relationship between AMZN and BABA PE and market cap.  We end up maxing out around $15B market cap for now, or about a 50% gain.   Tesla then goes on to run about $50B market cap for the next few years, which would put NIO up around $25 in the couple years ahead, again if it's discounted 50% for being Chinese.  Not bad.  It isn't really until the past 8 months that Tesla share prices go completely insane for some reason and get into a range I don't understand on either a hype or financial level.

*\*if NIO was cooking the books, I doubt the numbers reported in the past would look like they do.*",20,2020-07-06 18:02:43,405

"Something to always keep in mind, especially when the shorts/bears resort to outright lies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/hll493/something_to_always_keep_in_mind_especially_when/,"I'm pasting this from a post I decided to create an account specifically for, so I could rebuke it; this reply of mine was in response to an assertion make [Awareness-Infinite](https://www.reddit.com/user/Awareness-Infinite/) who seems to not understand the difference between an assertion, and an argument backed up my corroborative evidence. 

This is responding to the assertion that NIO is the same as Luckin coffee:

NIO is independently audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian, which can be read here: [https://ir.nio.com/resources/investor-faqs#:\~:text=NIO%20Inc.'s%20independent%20auditor%20is%20PricewaterhouseCoopers%20Zhong%20Tian%20LLP.](https://ir.nio.com/resources/investor-faqs#:~:text=NIO%20Inc.'s%20independent%20auditor%20is%20PricewaterhouseCoopers%20Zhong%20Tian%20LLP.)

In a SeekingAlpha article titled *PWC Zhong Tian: A Chinese Auditor With A Flawless Record* Adam Gefvert states that: ""The auditor that I've found to have an unblemished record is PriceWaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian. It has so far never signed off on a financial report that contained fraudulent numbers."" More can be read here: [https://seekingalpha.com/article/468691-pwc-zhong-tian-a-chinese-auditor-with-a-flawless-record](https://seekingalpha.com/article/468691-pwc-zhong-tian-a-chinese-auditor-with-a-flawless-record)

Luckin coffee had interestingly the same auditor as WireCard, an auditor called Ernst & Young--it was under Ernst & Young that the fraudulence happened; NOT under the auditor of NIO (PWC Zhong Tian\*)\*, who has a ""flawless record"" as stated by Adam Gefvert.

Who else does Ernst & Young audit you might ask? Hewlett Packard; Verizon; State Street; AT\&T; Coca Cola; General Motors; Hilton; Lockheed Martin; 21st Century Fox; The Carlyle Group--the list goes on.

So to recap: NIO is audited by an independent auditor deemed ""flawless"" and is NOT the same auditor that audited LK, or WireCard for that matter.

Context for Today's $1bln Investment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/gaeyvk/context_for_todays_1bln_investment/,"I have no position in NIO anymore but follow the stock.  Some things to put today's announcement into context:

* The investing entities are putting up RMB7bln (\~US$1bln).  They are receiving 24.1% of a new entity - NIO China which will consist of the cash + Nio's core business and assets in China.
* NIO (the stock you are buying) will own the remaining 75.9% of this entity

On this basis NIO's stake in NIO China should be worth $3.15bln ($1bln \* (75.9%/24.1%)).  NIO's market cap as of my writing is \~$3.9bln.  That is, if NIO only consisted of its 75.9% interest in NIO China you'd be paying \~25% more ($3.9/$3.15) to invest in NIO China than the municipal investors who are putting in RMB7bln.  Besides that:

&#x200B;

1. NIO has some non-Chinese assets/operations but they are cash-flow negative; they might be worth something but likely not much in the context of a $3.9bln market cap (and could be worth <$0).
2. NIO has \~$1.5bln of debt.  It is not clear if this is being assumed by the NIO China entity or if it will stay with NIO (my guess is primarily the latter).  If this stays with NIO you are paying \~$5bln+ to buy something the investors are paying the equivalent of \~$3.15bln for ($3.9bln market cap + \~$1.5bln of debt).
3. NIO is expected to contribute RMB4.26bln of cash to NIO China (\~US$600m).  NIO does not have US$600m of cash (if you're lucky they've got $300m).  NIO will need to raise funds somehow (more debt or more equity).  Along with the debt this would be \~$5.5bln+ that equity investors in NIO are paying for NIO China.
4. Unlike equity investors in NIO, the Chinese entities who are putting in $1bln are not purely motivated by the outcome of their investment in NIO China.  These are Chinese municipalities who are also getting spending commitments from NIO.  These entities put up $1bln but then that $1bln (along with Nio's $600m) largely gets spent in their city/province which supports jobs and tax revenues.  While I'm sure they'd love to do well on the investment they can take a hit and still have this work out for them - their return expectations/hurdles should be lower than typical equity investors.

All in all you're probably paying \~2x what the Chinese entities are for NIO China (at best \~1.25x) and those investors have other goals and aims than just making money on their investment which means they're probably willing to overpay to some extent.  On the other hand, you get some non-Chinese operations/assets that are probably worth little (but could have negative value) relative to the size of this entity.

&#x200B;

This investment does not justify the $5 or $9 per share some have speculated the stock is headed for.  Indeed, it doesn't even seem to justify a $3 stock.",12,2020-04-30 06:43:15,480

Correcting misinformation on this subreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/f3up77/correcting_misinformation_on_this_subreddit/,"New here but figured people could benefit from some clarity and truth on some of the topics I've seen discussed.  There's a lot of misinformation - rather than go to the individual posts and write a comment no one's ever going to see I figured I'd make a new post to deal with some of the important bits from the past few days.  Happy to answer questions.

1)Claim: Tencent increased their position & might buy Nio.  

Reality: The only money Tencent has put in recently came in Q3 of 2019 when they paid $100m for a convertible note; the recent 13G filing is just updating old information - it doesn't show any other new purchases by Tencent.  CEO Li Bin also put in $100m for a convertible note around the same time.  The terms were fairly bad for Bin and Tencent - this could be because they believe in the company or, more likely, this could be deemed rescue financing.  The fact that neither Tencent nor Li Bin participated in the 2 recent $100m raises (which were very expensive for Nio - see #2 below) should be cause for concern and would seem to indicate Tencent is not interested in acquiring Nio or investing more $ in the company.

&#x200B;

2) Claim: Purchase of recent $100m convertible notes is a signal that intelligent Asian funds believe in Nio.

Reality: With almost 100% confidence this is not true.  Almost certainly what the Asian funds did is:

* Buy a bond for $100m.  The bond converts into shares at \~$3/share or \~33m shares.
* Short sell \~33m shares at \~$4 (the price the stock was trading at at the time).
* In 6 months when they can convert the bond and trade the shares they will do so and deliver the shares against their short.

So in sum what they effectively did is (i) bought \~33m shares - which they'll receive in 6 months - at \~$3/share for $100m  and (ii) sold \~33m shares at $4+/share for $132m.  That's a profit of $32m that they'll realize (less the cost to borrow the shorted shares but borrowing Nio now is very cheap) in 6 months.  This is a no brainer and is in no way whatsoever an indication of belief in the business.  This is free money regardless of the quality or future performance of the underlying business; if NIO goes bankrupt they make \~$30m in 6 months (and in this one special case potentially more), if Nio goes to $20 they make \~$30m in 6 months, if Nio stays at $4 they make \~$30m in 6 months.

&#x200B;

3) Claim: Hedge Funds have recently been buying NIO stock

Reality: No, they have not.  The companies mentioned in the post making this claim, State Street and Charles Schwab are financial services companies not hedge funds.  As a large part of its business, State Street offers a number of ETF's which reflexively buy the stocks on a list someone else produces (SPDR is State Street's brand for these ""passive"" funds) - if Nio is on a list someone made that State Street has licensed because they think they can sell that list as an investment choice to retail investors (say Chinese stocks or EV stocks or Emerging Markets or US Listed >$1bln Market Cap) these entities will buy some Nio stock (simply because it fits a criteria that puts it on the list) on behalf of retail investors who have given State Street money to implement this simple strategy; there is no mastermind at State Street directing $ toward Nio because he thinks its a great company.  Charles Schwab is similar and only owns Nio in the ""Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF"".; again, no one at Charles Schwab is dictating that money go to Nio - this is not what Charles Schwab (nor State Street) do.  They are not hedge funds by any stretch of the imagination.",8,2020-02-15 05:35:52,526

Update:

**NIO delivered 1,598 vehicles in January 2020**, 11.5% lower than the same month last year. This decrease was primarily due to the reduction in business days in January due to the comparatively earlier Chinese New Year holiday in 2020. The extended holiday due to the unfortunate outbreak of the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China also affected our sales results. January 2020 deliveries consisted of 1,493 ES6s, the Company’s 5-seater high-performance premium electric SUV, and 105 ES8s, the Company’s 7-seater high-performance premium electric SUV and its 6-seater variant.

Baillie Gifford &amp; Co, one of Nio’s top shareholders, now owns 101M shares (up from 71M shares). 

That’s an additional 30M shares they now own. 

If these are new stocks issued (likely), this means effectively a 4-5% dilution for all of us shareholders (yet, stock’s going up, not down.. which makes sense because...)

... This also means $120M in new interest-free funding!! 🙌🏻

This is good news by every standard of corporate finance, especially when fundamentals are as strong as they are for Nio/China in 2020

"Other than low cash, any other issues?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/ee4lqh/other_than_low_cash_any_other_issues/,"I’m long on Nio with substantial exposure, despite all the bad press.

For me, I see a superior EV, backed by Tencent and a highly successful serial entrepreneur , at a fraction of its direct competitor, in the largest EV market that’s aiming to achieve 25% share of EVs in a few years, with only 1% market share and a large/growing distribution network. And on top of that, an excellent brand and a mass market model about to be released in a few days

And.. When Tesla launches properly in China , it’ll open up the EV market for all other players, not just itself.. 

So basically, it has everything going for it except:

- low cash on its balance sheet
- slow/stagnant growth in deliveries 

The latter is expected, when it still hasn’t launched its mass market model yet (a few days away..) 

the first is worrying, but it has never been a show-stopper for a company that has everything going for it. Whether they issue more stocks (dilution expected at first, which is fine..), or receive loans in the form of convertible bonds or others, or get bought out, that’s all good news for any retail shareholder. 

In my opinion, This is not a company that’s on the verge of bankruptcy.. the entirety of Wall Street got bailed out, cash is abundant and not hard to come by.. I know that’s not a fair comparison, but I highly doubly we will see a company declaring bankruptcy anytime soon.

Curious to hear what y’all think?",5,2019-12-23 01:56:02,609
So Nio has a few quitters so did Tesla,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/ee0ggr/so_nio_has_a_few_quitters_so_did_tesla/,"Nio is getting a ton of flak some deserved some not so much. I am on board with everybody else wondering where the heck are q3 numbers. We already know deliveries after December tend to slow down. So we might get a pullback. For the month of December 2019 Nio is on track for a little over 1600 deliveries as of 4 days ago. A few people at Nio have left the company throughout 2019 but so have people at Tesla look at the names below for people who resigned at Tesla. Nio is getting unfairly hammered and I hope people wise up and see this company is doing amazing things. Twitter search Nioq and you will see the shorts are bashing Nio hard and spreading a lot of negative news about the company and I mean a lot! Stay strong Longs .

"$NIO might be in negotiation for financing its own factory--one with a capacity of 200,000 cars",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/di6bat/nio_might_be_in_negotiation_for_financing_its_own/,"I posted this to r/stocks and r/investing

Recently, several articles have been released indicating a potential manufacturing plant for NIO in the works. it has been suggested from one of these articles that: ""From a number of people close to \[NIO\]"" that there may be a deal in the process with the city of Muzhou - in the Zhejiang province - to construct a manufacturing plant with the capacity of 200,000 units a year.

Interestingly, it appears that the CIO of NIO, William Li, claimed that the company was in contact with ""many local governments.""

It is claimed that NIO may receive ≈ 1.4 billion in financing to build its own factory in the aforementioned city; strangely, the same source (the second from the list *below*) states that this prospect, if it materializes, would be ""...the electric vehicle startup's second factory."" I wonder if they're referring to the NIO- JAC partnership?

What are your thoughts fellow investors? I imagine I'm not the only one who is suspicious of the fear mongering and hysteria surrounding this company; especially when explicitly stated shorts claim they *want* this company to go to zero--like on yahoo or stocktwits.

I estimate present value of shareholder's equity in Nio to be $5.1 billion. Prove me wrong,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/c3sc40/i_estimate_present_value_of_shareholders_equity/,"In light of the egregious short selling of Nio shares, and the consistent negative rhetoric being posted about Nio, I'd like to offer my own analysis of Nio's shareholder value.  [Based on analysis done by Citron Research](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Long-NIO-much-more-than-the-chinese-tesla.pdf) I think my valuation of $5.1 billion to be a *low-ball* estimate.  However I am long Nio so you should take this post with a grain of salt.  

&#x200B;

I used net present value (NPV) to value shareholder equity based *only* on the present value of cash inflows and outflows over a period of 20 years.  I ignore the value of any patents, branding, partnerships, etc.

&#x200B;

*Assumptions*:

* Analyst estimates for EPS to be -1.28 and -0.85 in 2018 and 2019 respectively 
* 2.5% market share in Chinese BEV by 2022, and 3% market share in Chines BEV by 2030 ([consistent with current market share trends in FY 2018 and 2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/425458/china-monthly-new-energy-vehicle-sales-by-type/))
* 2.2 Million BEV sales in China in 2022 
* 15% growth per year between 2022-2030 in Chinese BEV sales (on track with [Bloomberg EV sales estimate for 2030](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-14/china-is-about-to-shake-up-the-world-of-electric-cars-quicktake))
* 5% growth per year between 2030-2038 in Chinese BEV sales  
* $1.5 Billion dollars spent on new factory and R&D in FY 2021
* $600 Million dollars spent on new car R&D between 2022-2025
* 15% margin on revenue
* Discount rate of 10%

Face it: this company is going bankrupt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/bwc4m9/face_it_this_company_is_going_bankrupt/,"The cash burn is way too much.  No matter how you slice it they only have a few more quarters left with their burn rate.

And that’s even after implementing cost cutting measures in R&D / SG&A.

275 members on this POS sub.  What does that tell you? No instagram presence.  No social media covering NIO closely.  Nobody cares about this company, they are a Chinese copycat of Tesla. You can’t copy innovation though and Nio even settled on battery swapping for its vehicles because it can’t develop an ubiquitous super charger network like Tesla.

Tesla is hands down a more lucrative brand name, innovative company than NIO and it is in dire financial straits.  Has faced bankruptcy a multiple times in its life cycle and today is still having problems.

If the road for Tesla is that hard with a true first mover advantage, how much harder is it going to be for NIO?  NIO isn’t even getting preferential treatment from the Chinese government anymore since EV subsidies were cut (favoring much larger auto companies who can pivot and scale EV production down to meet a lower demand).

**THERE IS NO MASS DEMAND FOR NIO VEHICLES**

15k ES8 vehicles delivered to date after almost a year.  Laughable.  

Only 12k pre-orders for their BEST mass market play with an ES6.  These numbers are a fraction of what Tesla sells in a quarter today, and Tesla has much better margins since they are vertically integrated.  Nio has to pay JAC to manufacture its cars and its margins are utter shit.

It’s game over for this company. If any of you hold shares you should sell before it files for chapter 11.  You will never see your money back again.",0,2019-06-04 03:43:49,726
