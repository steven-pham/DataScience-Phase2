What are everyone's thoughts on the short-term low?
What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs opinion on the course of the stock within the first week compared to articles and coverage on Nio. I personally believe it‚Äôs all talk and Nio will eventually made a big upwards bounce.
....and It's cratering!
IPO
"NIO outperformed the market today. Tesla and the NASDAQ ended the day in the red, but NIO actually closed higher than yesterday! If all the other Tech stocks open at an uptrend tomorrow we could reach above 19.50 easily! üôÇ"
Flirting with $20 in pre market :D
And flop
Anyone hyped for those BaaS subscription numbers?

Possible resistance where we are right now or possible break through. Very interesting to see what will happen today
I prefer Nio's look
So cool to see them side by side
"Invested in both, let‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs blue skies ahead"
Tesla looks better lol. But I still like NIO.
Can't we love them both? üòÇ
 **Nio looks better!**
"Tesla has a more sportier look, sleek front. Nio more heavier build. Both nice üëçüèª"
They look oddly similar
Wayyyy better...
Nio looks amazing.
Nio. Interior also far nicer.
I prefer nio
"They both look good, but I think the thinner headlights and slightly more chiseled look of the Nio are a little more modern."
tesla looks better
"Depends on preference.  Both look amazing, personally I prefer NIO since it has more detail / curves.  Tesla just too smooth for me."
"Guys the future of automobile is already here....and it's not gonna be Audi's, Merc's, and BMWs. It will be equally Nio's and Tesla's. Let's smash those German big boys ashes once and for all!!! GO NIOüöÄüöÄ"
Entire investment portfolio in one picture.
"i liked the recessed lighting on the front of the NIO, but the Black top on the nio doesn't look as sleek on the white door section on the tesla."
Tesla reminds me of a luxurious Ford Taurus
"Tesla is better looking, i mean, nio looks awesome but tesla is just breathtaking !"
Not different enough to matter. IMO Tesla advantage because of winged doors.
Tesla looks more streamlined and sleek. There both good looking cars though.
Tesla looks a bit better and understated imo - that is until the silly doors open
I have done the same because i do believe this two companies gonna be huge in the future!
How about an interior comparison....
For interior I would hands down give it to Nio based on the fact that I've been inside one personally.
Well if I had a crystal ball... if you‚Äôre long on this stock and have done your DD I think you should be fine.
What date is the battery day of Tesla btw?
"I mean it all depends on what Tesla will show the world. Especially if the 1-million-miles battery and the plaid models will be showcased, it could mean a surge in stock price after the recent dips.
Anyway, I am excited for the event.
Just my honest opinion tho"
22.09
Ok.. this gave me an erection.
I counted at least 120 nio ec6 in the first picture
"128, more parked in top right corner not being used"
Somebody will update their predicted deliveries for September based on this picture.  Wait for it...
Brilliant on NIOs part. Give the investors something to smile about .
Serious question.  What will it take to get NIO into the US?  I am thinkin of trading in for a nissan leaf until I can save up for any NIO.
What's your stock price prediction for next Earnings Call. Hopefully it doesn't tank as it has happened before.
Strong EV company
Makes no sense either... everything is made there
I‚Äôm horny for nio 24/7
You're sick
Haha NIOtime is about to release predicted deliveries number. Watch for this soon.
Just time. They want to establish themselves in China and Europe first and it‚Äôd be good to wait for the US tensions to die down a bit so they can have a strong start. I‚Äôm definitely getting a EC6 or ET7 when they come to the US.
"Problem is, the term ""Chinese Junk"" is thrown around very loosly in North America. I'm not confident it will be very well received by home grown, middle Americans...not yet at least.

 It might do well in the areas with more diversity however (East/West coasts)."
How about a China-friendly president next year?
"Hi, I'm Nio"
"To be fair, if Nikola tweeted this picture their stock price would triple"
I agree.  The ‚Äúcoasts‚Äù seem more acceptable to new stuff.  Id love to get a chance to open a battery swap station for NIO in Jville florida.  We arent big but there are a few spots that i think it would make a good starting point for the company.  Many people in the area I live want EV just cant afford Tesla and wont settle down to a volt or leaf.
Im on East coast. Jax Fl. Not a ‚Äúmajor‚Äù hub like atlanta or orlando but I think jville could start a strong spread for ev users.
"doesn‚Äôt matter, US will always look at China as cheap. ‚Äúmade in china‚Äù means cheap usually in US. hopefully Nio can change that in the future.."
Ima ride you derty üí¶
"totally agree, reputation is hard to change."
"Good, cause I like em curvey"
Great news as always
Literally copy and pasted from yahoo finance üòÇ
Idk if Tesla needs China.
"Why is this an argument? Tesla and NIO HAVE China.
The market is 98% open ready for everyone, NIO and TSLA are not competing with each other, they're competing with the grotesque machines out there."
Idk just get me the damn ET in California already
qbio and nio good combo on my porfolio
"China is going to be the biggest EV market in the future. Actually, I think they might be the biggest EV market already.  

If something is going to be 50% of your market, you kinda ""need"" it."
"Take a look at Tesla‚Äôs stock history prior to 2018 before entering Chinese market as first entirely US based company. China has as much middle class as US and EU combined and it‚Äôs still growing rapidly.Tesla will do fine without China but the stock price would absolutely not been where they are today. Looking at their earning on Q2 , literally saved by Chinese market as same thing can be said to Apple. Average joes doesn‚Äôt understand the potential of Chinese market but wall street knows better than anyone. Do you think Tesla could go over 2K per share without financial institutions behind it to fuel to profit over %100 jump in the past two months?"
In the long run Tesla might need china to at least even out there sales when everybody is used to 3 minute battery swap a merger or aggrement of somewhat to use Nios Baas infastractufre we are talking about the whole china here.
"You just need a thriving and growing market, plenty of auto manufacturers are successful and they only appeal to ridiculous luxury and niche markets. Certainly not strong on the global aspect, but they profit and that‚Äôs what matters. You could have 90% of the global market but if you‚Äôre not profitable, you‚Äôre not profitable. 

Tesla could also pick up a lot more market share by doing something such as making a more entry level car that average consumer could afford, whether it‚Äôs the states, Europe, or Asia. 

Domestic Chinese brands need to do more to hold and gain their market share. https://carsalesbase.com/china-car-sales-analysis-2019-brands/

According to that article, sales for domestic brands have declined for 3 years while sales for foreign brands have risen. I‚Äôm not saying nio isn‚Äôt, I mean they‚Äôre a fourth of my portfolio, but they need to rise above the trend themselves or on a long enough time line, that wouldn‚Äôt be good news."
"There‚Äôs still a long way to go though before we can say everyone used to 3 minute battery swaps, nios still making higher end cars like Tesla, they both need the common man for taking market share to really matter. 

When it comes to batteries, I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs head of Tesla on their tech. The swap is just a great way to compete against that using a different strategy entirely."
"I agree with everything you said, but a lot of them don't really relate to the first point you made in Tesla needing China.

It depends on your definition of ""need"" really. I believe Tesla is already profitable, so technically they don't ""need"" China. But they would be crazy to let this market go.

I think the most accurate statement is, if you want to be the top EV company, you will need China."
"That‚Äôs probably more accurate, or be the top dog everywhere else outside of China. I certainly don‚Äôt think they should ignore that market by any means. There‚Äôs so many ways to see Tesla though and a lot of them aren‚Äôt really wrong."
"I have a number of 20c 1/15/2021 calls, along with stock and a variety of short-term stock positions between 21-23.

Obviously, it's speculation to assume what the price would be.   However, they've been delivering nothing but good news (and record breaking car numbers).   There's better DD in here and you should research a bit yourself to get a vibe for whether it's a worthwhile investment and how much you're willing to risk.

That said, their December production numbers and quarterly report should be released on 1/4/2021 and NIO day should be toward end of December.   I'm planning on holding the calls toward end of expiration depending on how they're performing.    Compared to other EV performance, I believe they could hit 30-35 per share by that point.

Keep in mind that there's some risk in production challenges, expansion and cash flow, etc.  And while they are producing more cars every month, they still need to have the market share to sell those cars.    This all looks good now, but my recommendation would be to monitor the stock and have a strategy on when to exit if things start looking rocky - I have faith that NIO will prevail across the board in the long run, but you'll need to be unattached enough to be willing to sell the shares if there are significant drops and re-enter on recovery.

On the other side of this, if NIO does soar consider at what point you're willing to take some profit and plan your strategy - as the price increases, it'll be pushing ATH and those may not always be sustainable short-term.   I'll likely sell some of my position if they hit 23-25 to cover cost of investment.

If you're holding shares, just keep them forever.   I like the concept of taking half the profits made and convert into shares that don't evaporate quickly, but you'll know your risk tolerance and appetite better.   Good luck."
I have a LEAP Dec2022 $20C currently already at a 20+% gain. I bought it OTM when share price was around $17
"This is a great idea, thanks. Im new to trading so honestly I never even thought about selling some contracts half way through if its up to recoup initial investment."
-sigh- fine let me get the lube
People are going to regret not buying more of this stock
"Good find and great points.

I'm bullish on Nio. 

However, I suspect there are some supply chain constraint that will keep their capacity at 5,000 for some months. In addition, Tesla's Model 3 and Xpeng's P7 also get the subsidy."
"Good info.  Blue skies coming, can‚Äôt deny it."
"Damn it, I can only get so hard"
Blue Sky ain't the only thing coming!
"Thanks -- NIO has dual motors as standard equipment. Would the others vehicles you mention have dual motors or be considered in the luxury category. I think all EVs in the luxury category are over RMB 300,000 & hence not eligible for rebate but I am not an expert in that matter"
Raining green!
Factsss
"They are both considered luxury vehicles and are under 300,000. Tesla intentionally reduced the price of the Model 3 in China to below RMB 300,000 so that it could get the rebate."
Now THAT is why I love nio
"I think a lot of people are a bit unrealistic in their expectations, like in May it was about $3, June $6, July $12, August $14-15 and now September it's around the $19+ Mark. Personally I think this is pretty amazing, the ""25 by EOM"" or ""100 by EOY"" people need to chill a bit."
That $20 is like a brick wall haha
Any reason it‚Äôs dropped?
Looks like the tesla chains are broken guys
I think Nio is doing aight today Bc it‚Äôs somewhat disconnected from Jpow and the rest of the AmEricaN companies
Hoping for that < 18$ to add more
17.50... then buy buy buyü§ë
What a start
"Lol thats why I held, look at the spike back up"
Same
Get as much as you can and hold
So I can buy 100 more shares
entire market is red
"Nah, it's still pretty much in lock step with Tesla, it's just a higher base for Nio today. Two days ago it was pretty much the same deal, but it was Tesla who had like a 6% ""lead"" over Nio."
You gonna buy in at 18? Or think it‚Äôll drop lower
If you guys are long term holders why are you worried about daily fluctuations? Unless you're trading the stock or options then it makes sense.
Let‚Äôs go!!! A lot of positive vibes floating around the web!!
blows my mind how much money is being thrown at NKLA. They have nothing tangible and basically committed fraud
Not selling until 1 stock is worth $600
Might as well sell nio to Tesla the way they follow in the damn shadows lol. The whole market is hinging on every move by Tesla. Even the medical sector.
Are we breaking the Tesla chain?
What a morning
Good luck. That makes sense if you have calls. I hope they get deep in the money soon.
Stock?
"Hmm I just read that Xpeng is starting to sell cars in Norway now! Should we be worried about that??

I'm thinking to also buy Xpeng stocks If that goes up :O"
Well that was a boring start. Wtf is this 0% shit? I'd rather see red. The suspense is killing me.
[deleted]
"I bought 100@3 and then another 100@1.20
Idgaf what happens in the day to day haha"
Personally got calls that expire 9/25 so hoping we get action soon. Mostly stocks though.
Because just in case the market crashes I gotta pull out. Gotta watch my investment
These are all wrong answers and I don't know if any of you know about dollar averaging. Sell when its high buy back when it drops. Although there is risk this is how gained 40% in my portfolio in the last month
Yup! I‚Äôm finally in the green again :D
Just be careful with those goals! That would value NIO at over 500b which is over 100b more than Tesla is currently valued.
This is accurate in 5 years when nio takes over much of china's ev market. 1.3 billion people i see it as a possibility with baas and the other innovative services they will continue rolling out. William LI is not going to stop being a go getter its in his blood.
"Doubt it, and a growing company like nio is very unlikely to perform a share buyback program in the next few years, possibly even 10 years"
"Well to be honest, Nio have done better since August in %"
"Nio slightly green when Tesla is slightly red. Let‚Äôs take this as a win and see if this hold up at the end of the day.

Edit: damnit"
It‚Äôs been trending downward. XPENG is overpriced IMO
"I've been putting 22 calls for end of September and 23 calls in October.   I have had 20c for January since July and about 500 shares.  
I think 25 is Huawei buys in is realistic in October.  Battery day may bump down NIO for a few days however from a competition standpoint (eg if Tesla has a million mile lifetime battery reveal).
I'd like to see NIO hit 40 by NIO day which should be toward end of December?    Not sure if the date has been announced yet."
Me too... smh
You don't know what you're talking about. You sound like someone who just got into the market recently and has made 40% and is now overly confident and thinks they know everything. Don't be that over confident person who thinks I'm an expert just because you made 40%. This is probably the most idiotic comment I've read on this sub.
just a start
Too bull
Also the European market and US will help achieve those goals
ü§îü§îü§î
Typical vegeta big head lol I'm more like goku myself but you can call me kakarot üòÉ
At least this sentence of yours made more sense than your last one.
Refer to me as sensai üòä your making me blush ‚ò∫
"Not a report, but the US election could have a big input on the stock price."
Not a report but Nio day is in December
Earnings for Q3 is December 27. Not November.

You could add proper spacing to make it readable.
Do check up our curated catalyst according to month. [NIO Catalyst ](https://niotime.substack.com/p/nio-catalysts/comments)
"If Biden wins, I believe the stock price will follow the overall market and dip. Afterwards, it will rocket as he start to introduce green energy policies and people start to think of NIO expanding to the US as he's certainly more lax and agreeable towards China than Trump. 

If Trump wins, NIO's expansion to US will definitely be delayed until after 2024. The stock will still go up in the long run with expansion to Europe in sights albeit not as fast as it would in the first scenario.

These theories are just off the top of my mind so it's not very indepth. What are your thoughts?"
why? NIO's market is in china?
What ive been hearing all month üëÄ
Does it have anything to do with the et7?
Holding until December. Got it.
What day?
"expect nio day,this year is in chengdu ,chengdu car owners are very very Passionate"
"Where did you see this?    WeBull shows earnings report on November 10th Before Open.

I haven't found much info, but this would track that their Q3 earnings would likely fall around NIO day."
"I agree, the green energy deal should rocket the overall economy as I assume it has in other countries."
Biden will definitely support a Chinese green energy car company moreso than Trump. There's no doubt in my mind that a President Biden is a large win for NIO.
Then he equalizes the gains with higher cap gains tax? Lol
I don‚Äôt think they have announced the date yet. Last year it was December 27.  Rumor is mass manufacturing of ET7 (sedan) in 2021 will be announced on NIO day.
Of 2025*
Last year Q3 report December. Robinhood says December 27
what other countries?
biden will support chinese car copmpany? i think every president will hate good chinese company
"If you thought I meant this December and not December 2025. You are wrong. I thought I was extremely obvious.

That was a joke..... a terrible one I guess"
Expansion probably meaning mew factory and more job for US. You are okay with Tesla dominating the EV market around the world but hating a Chinese company having a piece of that ? That‚Äôs very biased.
"i am too worried nio will be influenced by chinese america relation,because nio is chinese most hopeful car company, nio may be attack just for it is an chinese company and great in ev market"
"like huawei in europe , a great chinese ev company to america is dangerous"
"""Around 4,000 contracts of the October $23 calls were bought Tuesday for 75 cents. The trade breaks even at $23.75 or almost 25% above Tuesday's closing price. Najarian owns these calls and he has a couple of weeks for the trade to work.""

Sounds like people banking on Nio hitting $24+ next month.  Tesla is bound to have a boost on the 22nd for battery day, and historically Nio gets to tag along for the ride whenever the EV leader sees a boost.  Could be a good play."
Good research thx
Here is hoping!
"It's a huge positive if it bears out.  Eliminates a lot of battery degradation anxiety, which doesn't matter in China, but will matter very much in the eu."
million kilometer total...not million kilometer on a single charge
"So i saw this on twitter regarding Tesla‚Äôs upcoming batter day, it‚Äôs obviously not confirmed to be true, but if it was, what do you think the influence on NIO‚Äôs stock would be? Could it potentially be positive since NIO and Tesla seem to move up and down together??"
Nio will be buying teslas swappable battery lol.
"One of the things I love about NIOs battery as a service is that they can swap batteries with better and newer technology to reduce cost over time.    They likely will still charge the BaaS fee, since customers can swap fully charged batteries in 3 minutes without having to recharge, but their operating cost will go down.   Allowing more battery swap station expansions. 
Any EV technology will benefit NIO in the long run.    Short term investors may cause a dip without understanding.the potential, but I wouldn't be too concerned unless you're holding short term options.
I'm considering selling my 9/25 options before or on battery day but maintaining long calls and stocks without worry."
Why doesn‚Äôt battery degradation matter in China?
Yeah
"my 2 cents: it will benefit NIO, it will hurt ICE sales"
"BaaS.  Consumers won't be tied to their batteries in the same way they are if purchase price includes a battery and ties you to that battery's lifecycle.  I think BaaS is primarily about dealing with the lack of private parking infra in Chinese residences - often hi rises, little control over which space to park in etc, versus in the US where people tend to have a private garage or parking spot.  But even in the US, BaaS is compelling especially for people that live in outdoor parking apartment complexes w/o dedicated power."
"Makes sense.  I guess my thought was that a better battery is always preferred.  Would lower lifecycle costs for the BaaS operators.  Even if so, I see how it‚Äôs not a huge deal.  I think, were I a Tesla owner, that I‚Äôd prefer them to announce a significant range increase on a single charge."
The purpose of Baas is that NIO owners will always be able to enjoy newest battery technology since it‚Äôs progressing every year. I don‚Äôt see how huge impact this will made to NIO.
"What a heck of a rollercoaster since, glad I‚Äôve stayed the entire journey"
Cant wait for their cars to be available in the US
I'll buy the EC6 as soon as it becomes available in US.
Had to pull back with low price because of leverage.. Rode again so let's keep goin' above 100 together and till Nio becomes like a dividend stock company üçÄ‚òÄÔ∏è

>If you own shares of a stock that gets delisted, **nothing really changes**. You still have your ownership share in the company, but the means of trading your shares and the value of your shares could be drastically different.  
>  
>Delisting comes with a scarlet letter. Most stocks get delisted because their share prices have fallen to less than $1 and they no longer meet exchange listing requirements. These companies are generally considered either failed, speculative or unviable altogether. That means they'd typically draw little interest from the investing public. You could potentially trade shares in the less regulated OTC market, however, so there is still an outlet if you wish to buy or sell.  
>  
>**A company like Alibaba, however, isn't your typical delisted stock. If it's removed from the U.S. exchanges, there's little doubt that the market for shares drops considerably and the value probably falls significantly.** These companies would probably just list their shares on a different exchanges.

Delisting isn't going to change the company's fundamentals. If the company is doing good, it will continue to do good. Also, delisting isn't going to happen overnight. There will be news. For short/mid term investors, the price drop will hurt, but for long term investors, it's nothing more than noise. 

Personally, I think NIO is developing at a good pace and I believe it will do very well in the next 5-10 years. With that, I'm holding onto NIO stocks, regardless of which SE its traded at."
Looks like NKLA is getting delisted before any other Chinese companies üòÇ
"There‚Äôs only 1 headquarter in the US with no factories. (I think) NIO purposely delay making any cars or putting any money in the US for the time being because the word is going around that Trump is delisting Chinese companies and the child-like tendency to hurt Chinese companies, which is preventing NIO from for losing money. Until the election shows that Trump is no longer president (unless Biden wants to delist Chinese companies too but idk), then NIO may start making decisions. But let say Trump doesn‚Äôt want Chinese companies to work in the US anymore, all NIO would lose is 1 HQ."
"Your shares get sold for the last trading price 

No one knows what will happen it‚Äôs just a gamble no matter what you think you know."
Its almost game time boys!
Wonder if we‚Äôll break that $20 resistance level this week?
"There she goes!!!!

Next stop: Alpha Centauri"
"Seriously people... 62k volume on the $20c weeklies with OI starting at 27k... given this trade action, you guys/gals/algos are weak hands. Stop freaking out and selling!"
How high will she fly? The magic question
Stock predictions by the end of September!??!
BUY MORE
I think we will trade down to 18-19 for the week so i got in puts at 20.
"Nice day, nothing fancy but gains are gains.

Where do you see the stock short term (year end) and medium term (2-3 years) ?

What are your exit prices ?"
I‚Äôm in a bit of a rut right now and could use the extra $350 I have in NIO.  All I have in my portfolio is 19 shares of NIO.  I don‚Äôt want to pull out though :( WHAT DO I DO
Nio to the moon and beyondüöÄüåô
And flop
I‚Äôm about to tap out. This is going nowhere fast
Almost? When do you think game time starts?
Let‚Äôs break it today baby
Just broke $20
Broken boi 20.15
High. I recon $21 if not more as long as it keeps the momentum
[deleted]
"Depends on what you mean by a rut, like if you can't pay your rent or your power is getting turned off rhn sell (plus don't invest until you're more comfortable) if you just want the money for something you can do without then don't sell."
Hold bro
too early to tell at the moment.
"Sorry, You can‚Äôt sit with us"
930 am officially
Let's break it this hour at this point
Just the tip
To the moon then üöÄüöÄüöÄ
It‚Äôs shit like this Reddit
Good advice.
I just spread out some of the gains i thankfully cashed in on this morning
I‚Äôm still in it.. 500 shares deep
Enjoying today's game so far
Haha yeah insane so far
It looks much better than the Model Y imo.
"I like how the logo of NIO is very clean. Very modern and simple. Tesla also has a very clean and modern logo. I could see NIO as a global leader in EV. NIO is also a very nice name just like Tesla. Compared to other companies like Xpeng and Li Auto, NIO just sounds clean and better. Just my thought lol"
"It looks clean af. Really nice, so far"
"Looking pretty damn sharp.  Once the ET7 hits the US, I‚Äôm buying.  I‚Äôm not just saying that because I‚Äôm invested... I think it‚Äôs a stunner"
Sleek looking!
Impressive.. most impressive.
Look at the rear lights- it purposely designs like a heart beat signal. Boom!
No you're absolutely right. These things matter especially in a global market.
"I think Xpeng's logo is pretty clean, but I have no idea how people would want a ""li"" on their car. It's kinda hideous.

But yeah, even though their logo is good, Xpeng as a global brand name is not really great."
"I completely agree with you. I‚Äôm also invested in SPAQ (soon to be FSR, Fisker) and their logo really pales in comparison."
"Dude I just looked that up since you commented and wow I had no idea how great the ET7 looks, in fact I had no idea that was a new model they are working on. Thanks for sharing mate. Looks schweeett"
"Xpeng in chinese is a very stupied name, many chinese customers hate  Xpeng name.because Xpeng is a normal chinese man name,very normal,vary cheap."
"li in chinese means ""dream"", so it is ok.but Li‚Äòs car is vary bad ,usually has to repair"
Yes sir.. I see big things coming for NIO üöÄ
1600 shares locked in loaded leggo
"Thata boy üëèüèΩ
The future of EV cars is giant and NIO is gonna be a premium marque player on the global stage soon enough"
The model y looks ugly imho
"No. The ET7 sedan, ET5 coupe, and ES3 sub compact will be NIO‚Äôs biggest sellers! üòéüëåüèæ"
This sub is too bull
NIO going to the moon(cake) confirmed
Great marketing.. I didn't even get an oil change coupon when I bought my Veloster..
Were they good? Why the Redmi stamp on your pictures?
"Wow NIO owners get mooncakes? ü•Æ 


Here, we get free coffee from the dealer. Sometimes not at all."
These are taken by Redmi and source is taken from weibo user.
Yo I have the xiaomi how do I take the stamp off lol
"‚ÄúI was hoping it‚Äôd be more low profile still.‚Äù 

Don‚Äôt be that guy. Don‚Äôt be the hipster who wants to be into Nio BEFORE it was cool. Just appreciate the slow and steady climb to the top. Less volatility the better"
Likely a lot of people that think they missed the Tesla train hoping for a quick high return on investment.
Now if the short sellers would piss off for a bit
Priced high? Its severely undervalued
" 2490 shares and will buy regardless of price 2,20, 25 it doesn‚Äôt matter I‚Äôm just in accumulation mode like most others ...... that‚Äôs why shorting volume has decreased drastically! GLTA..... excited for 2nd half 2021 for the global push, it will be worth the wait"
Its far from low profile. Nio has consistently been in the top 5 highest volume stocks on NYSE on a daily basis. Stock price is seeing support on any significant price drops. I'm pretty sure wall street is trying to accumulate this stock.
Its \*facepalm\*
Cut the damn Tesla chord already!!!
Eod predictions lots of mixed sentiment recently
Hold nio something weird is going on
Too many short sellers dragging price down
 üíØmy port on nio puts  9/18
"Looks like it cut, Tesla taking off while NIO down lol"
People will always short the stock!! It‚Äôs apart of the game... it‚Äôs time for you to accept it and move on. Really tired of reading about people complaining about the obvious
Right... fucking senseless. They drop 2 cent nio falls a dollar. They‚Äôre up 30$ we bottom out.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"NIO gets shorted a lot because of the Tesla longs hedging against EV market risk.    
    
They‚Äôre long on Tesla, so to reduce their risk they short NIO, because if TSLA goes up, NIO is likely to go up, but if TSLA is down, NIO is down a lot more."
Yeah doesn‚Äôt make sense :/
Holy t\*ts we're going to Proxima Centauri!
Was just about to come here and post this. This is huge.
 NIO = no brainer long term investment.
Tesla tried same but they get huge losses. Will it be worth for NIO?
It didn‚Äôt work in the use because of capitalism
On ‚ÄúBattery Day‚Äù Elon is going to endorse battery swapping model on China...I hope.
"This is fucking gigantic news. Especially because of Nio‚Äôs patents. I have no doubt in my mind Tesla will eventually adopt swapping in at least one model. Musk basically gave or sold swapping to Li Bin and with Tesla being well received in China, there‚Äôs no reason Tesla wants to be the odd man out in China that doesn‚Äôt swap batteries. I can see why Musk didn‚Äôt want to do battery swapping himself. Just the infrastructure alone while growing Tesla could have possibly been catastrophic to the growth of Tesla trying to juggle too many things at once. But as the article says Tesla is full capable of phasing in swaps. üöÄ"
May work in china. Tesla tried in the states but apparently americans in general arent in favor of it. No support from state government as well.
didn‚Äôt work in the US because some Americans love their Ford F-150s and big ass trucks
"Better yet, Teslas that are able to battery swap"
"I think they would get more tesla owners, battery anxiety is a real issue..."
Is or will NIO ever have self driving cars?
"When they will build a nio factory?
Expect delivery date in US market?"
"For those who don't get the battery swap free, what is the cost of a battery swap?"
has aspects of self driving already.
There are some self-driving Nio experiments at California from what I‚Äôve read.
"No plans to build a factory and probably never will (since Nio's strategy is to expand rapidly, capital is better spent elsewhere rather than on building its own factory; cant have it both ways especially when the company's cashflow isnt that great)

it will export to europe before the US, so probably earliest 2024. There isnt a huge benefit to exporting overseas so early when the primary market, china, has a lot more growth potential."
Maybe hopefully when the ET is ready for production
https://www.nio.com/baas
Thank you
Aw man I will check it out!  I hear more about battery swaps than the other tech. Fig Id ask.  Thank you too.
After it‚Äôs confirmed whether Trump will win/lose the election. He never like China so he‚Äôll give NIO a hard time doing business in the US.
"NIO has confirmed plans to expand to Europe in the next year. Europe first, then USA. Europe will definitely come before 2024, and the US will likely as well."
"My question is, what is the one-time cost for a one-time battery swap? The article you sent details the monthly BaaS suscription cost."
And has intel working hard at it.
You kinda repeated what i said
"BaaS started quite recently, they might have come to a guess on that value.  
Need to wait before they disclose the cost.

There are variables like energy costs in different areas. 143$ for the service might be in shangai where they started, either they make a universal cost or adjusts for each region"
Thats even cooler to know. Maybe start investing in Intel.  Thank you
What did you say?
I wouldnt invest in Intel lol

" I believe NIO will deliver 5000 Vehicles in September ,sending the share price to $20 early October"
"I expect to see ATH share price just before 3Q Earnings Call. Should be close to $22. 
If they can break the profitability ceiling then the share price will experience a boost to overvalued levels by year end.
If they don't report profit we will continue to see the same price range of $17 to $19 for another 6 months."

looks awesome!
Love the interior design and the how natural it looks.
Bang tidy
"Looks like a m6, 2020 rav4 hybrid lol"
Anybody know where we can see a NIO in the USA?
Any idea how many preorders and when it will be delivered?
What a beauty.  Thanks for sharing.
What price?! Is it awesome too ?
"I‚Äôm not racist by any means, but I‚Äôve noticed Asian people liking SUVs type cars more than any other type of cars.

I am new to reddit and I assume awards are meant to encourage. Thank you for the awards.
[deleted]
Go to the NIO research center in California. You may get a chance to view their gallery car there.
Write NiO ec6 price into google.
Nah sedans are still the preferred choice of vehicles in china. Pretty sure there are statistics you can check. Think it would have been better if nio rolled out the et series before the ec6
Pretty popular consensus that NIO Interiors are more comfy too
Thanks for the tip!
I want an et already.
"great format, the NIOtime Weekly Newsletter, love it!"
"Wow, this is really nicely done newsletter! Good job. Looking forward to see next one's!"
"This is really good, the 2nd Gen ES6 L4 if true looks way too futuristic to fit into the rest of nio's lineup."
So are we team Nio looking positive?
Do you know what the one-time cost of a one-time battery swap is?
Thanks for your kind comment!
Thank you for your kind words. I hope this help to summarize the highlights. Please do comment if anything else you hope to read about.
"Yes according to nio app, owners who orders the cars before 10/12 will get life free battery exchange service as incentive. Any order after will only entitle free for first six swaps in a month, on seventh the swap will be charged based on the difference of battery power level before and after times the cost of electricity and service charge."
Nio always wins
Has anyone read any news on et7 lately?
I saw a news article saying that all Chinese electric vehicle companies are going to fall soon. Does anyone think this says something about nio.
What about it?
Checking if there is any news that i have missed on it? Im guessing its still scheduled to debut on NIO day?
Dont think the boom till 24/25 will come just yet. Hopefully we can finish the week above 18.5.
Yeah im not sure what today is going to bring i just keep getting my average down even if its only 10 or 20 cents
What a rollercoaster ! I‚Äôll be quite happy if we finish the week at 18 or a little more.
"Last months uptake was halfway trough the month, hopefully that pattern can be reproduced! üöÄIve absolutely no idea whats going on with the market atm they litterly all over the place! Just holding üòÇ"

I‚Äôm done
Above19ü§ûü§ûü§û
Sooo close!
Anyone else notice nio is not following tesla share price today this could be really bullish. Also that investorplace article that just came out is total rubbish. There trying to scoop shares on the low before trump releases a stimulus relief plan. Lol
How is there zero sense there is plenty of sense with the market being down nio is treading water super bullish if you ask me
Above 20‚úå
Green red green red green red and we ending GREEN lets go gang
It's not looking good.....üò≠üò≠üò≠
"Yeah, too many options holders at $18c, $19c, and $20c and not enough enthusiasm for the stock price to run this gauntlet. You can see the furious selling of the $18c‚Äôs today... I did end up picking up some $17.50c near the bottom to even me out.

Overall, the macros took a dump and the rest of the market went with it, closing near $18 is pretty good."
Its only going down so it can jump up
I need your vibe man.....ü§ûüëå
"Tesla and Nio are closely tied together, a little TOO close for my liking. It make sense since Tesla is biggest dog of the pack (EV Stocks), but Nios graph can almost be placed flush on top of Tesla‚Äôs graph recently. It just stings knowing that Nios success relies so heavily on Tesla‚Äôs success, as far as the stock goes. Unlike Tesla and all the other EV companies In the market, NIO is honestly the most fairly valued."
"For better or worse, Nio is in Tesla‚Äôs shadow (Tesla of China?). Interest in Tesla drives interest in Nio and usually both go up and down together. Some day Nio will stand on it‚Äôs own."
Until NIO‚Äôs fundamentals turn into consistent profits it will always be tied to Tesla. Tesla is the benchmark potential for EV‚Äôs lately and until NIO breaks free with its own run of quarterly profits it will always be driven by sentiment.
It‚Äôs tied to Tesla
">Unlike Tesla and all the other EV companies In the market, NIO is honestly the most fairly valued.

Any metric to back that up? Genuinely curious"
"Agree.  I feel like NIO will need a breakout moment to stand on its own.  Could be profit, could be double shifting the manufacturing, could be...lots of things."
Y though?
"Yeah sure, there‚Äôs a number of factors to take into account. 1) China has the biggest market for EV‚Äôs and it helps that the Chinese government is pushing for electric because of their pollution problem. 2) nearly 50% of analysts ratings rank it a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù the second leading percentage ranks it ‚Äúhold‚Äù when compared to Tesla which only 20% of analysts rank a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù and 50% rank it a ‚Äúhold‚Äù. 3) NIO has a market cap of 16+ billion, trading at around 18. Li auto which is it‚Äôs closest counterpart in the market trades at about 17 with a market cap of 10 billion. Li auto recorded it‚Äôs biggest monthly sales of 2700 vehicles in August whilst NIO also recorded its biggest monthly sales in August at 3900 vehicles. I can go on and on, but regardless all of the EV stocks are growth stocks so a lot tend to be overvalued, I can only think of one obvious loser though *cough* Nikola *cough*"
"It's in the same EV market. Tesla is also the bigger player/representative of the EV market. So however Tesla moves, other EV entities move in correlation."
"Analyst target price is not a reason to suggest the price is under/over/fairly valued.

Using market cap as a comparison is meaningless. Companies dilute their outstanding shares all the time. An effective metric is revenue per share for companies who arent profitable. Nio is way higher than tesla.

Number of deliveries is also a poor comparison. Li auto and nio arent in the same category.

Yes, fk nkla. That i agree."
Thank you!
The same idea when it comes to airlines. AAL and LUV are aligned because both are in the same industry.
"This! Until the big legacy auto makers either go bankrupt or start producing all ev cause the market has full shifted. 

Until then we will see a lot of Nio‚Äôs success riding on Tesla in the short term. Which is going to be a positive imo"
"You mean a P/E ratio? I‚Äôd normally use that too, but my broker doesn‚Äôt have one posted for NIO."
"Obviously, it has no profits."
Great post my friend!! I feel like you have helped validate the NIO subreddit. Would you buy another NIO in the future or would you consider a model Y instead? Just curious..also how much of a selling point is Nomi? Seems really slick!!
Solid review. Thanks
"What a nice review. really enjoyed the cons because that are the comments neglected most of the time. BaaS seems to be a huge challenge ahead! I was surprised they only store 6 batteries, why not 20/30/40 and how about reservations on the swap? Would be a nice addition they are probably working on. Also great to hear that it‚Äôs not perfect as there is a lot or room for improvement. 

Let‚Äôs hope the growth will not make them neglect essential parts in their business concept. Thanks for sharing!!!!"
Great review of the overall car.  I always wondered how many batteries they can store in a station.  Thanks for the review.
"nice review! good work! 

i got a quick but unrelated question (saw the link below your review): do you know if driving tests differ across provinces in China? 

i got a temporary license, planning on getting the official one. Thanks"
Awesome job here! Have you talked to Xpeng owners? Is NIO brand much more superior than Xpeng?
"For those that don't get the free battery swap, do you know how much it cost for a single battery swap?"
"Nomi has insane long waiting queue! I don't know why it's so difficult to manufacture, perhaps also due covid19. And yeah for me the Tesla Model Y is also fine, but since I live in China I'd prefer a Chinese brand myself."
Thank you!
"Nio's BaaS 2.0 thats coming soon will help with this challenge. They'll hold more batteries, be able to charge the batteries quicker, and do battery swaps even quicker, I think this will be in action early 2021."
"I don't know that, I only know about the Shanghai one. I doubt they differ a lot, but maybe they don't offer English exams."
The app shows the value is ~32 RMB I think
How about over the air software updates?
"May I ask you some things? 

Have you spoken to other Nio owners? And what is the general opinion towards Nio in China? 

Really looking forward making its move towards the EU! Thanks again"
"I didn't do that yet, or perhaps the staff at the battery swap do that for me."
"I spoke to other Nio owners but not really about the car itself. Although some considered buying a Tesla S too, the fact that it's American doesn't really matter, but some find it too small or the interior too ugly. Most owners are pretty young, late 20s to late 30s, sometimes a bit older."
It's be nice if +$20 was a good base line. Im all set to jet.
Got in on $18. Deleted my app :). See ya'll later
$18 and I'm very very very happy. I know it will continue to go up.
"My calls break even at 19.50... expire Friday! Eh I‚Äôm ready to take a loss, but I hope we can break 19 Friday or before üôÇ"
Seems to be getting a lot of resistance at 18.50. It's trailing most of the EV market today
Dropping real hard right now
All over the map today. What the actual fuck is happening. This morning the value was up when Volume was down. Now it‚Äôs just dropping out for whatever reason
All this negative Nikola news must be good for Nio.
F\*ck'n Oath! Happy if it rises slowly as long as its rises!
Itll be a red day today I reckon.üòîüòî
"I have a $19c expiring tomorrow. Breakeven is $21.29, so it‚Äôd be great to breakeven on it"
"Ive noticed the same. It's been sideways between 17-19 for a week or so, with occasional dips following the TSLA crash. This despite many buy ratings and price target raises. Maybe the world is waiting for more good news from them before it breaks out. My hope is that we can establish $20 as the new normal for a while. That would make me feel more comfortable that we will not backslide below my average price paid. 308 shares for the long haul...."
"There has been a lot of weekly $18c, $19c, and $20c open interest. That provides a lot of resistance."
"I wouldn't call this hard but all markets are red today. Don't worry, it will bounce back eventually."
"Just a volatile stock, stay in it for the long run, it‚Äôll be interesting to see what happens to NIO when Tesla‚Äôs do their new announcement on their battery day"
Amen. There's also far lower volume than normal[Price](https://i.imgur.com/5lOqc6I.jpg)
"shanghai composite had its worst day in 5 months. 
tech continues to drop as well. 
it‚Äôs volatile for sure!"
Itll do whatever tesla does
Newb here. How do calls create resistance?
"Happy Cake Day Norpar! Forget about the past, you can‚Äôt change it. Forget about the future, you can‚Äôt predict it. Forget about the present, I didn‚Äôt get you one."
"Due to delta hedging, the sellers of the call options have to buy sufficient stock to remain delta neutral. If there is a lot of open interest (OI)  at a strike and time is short, within 3 days of expiration, the time premium on these options eroded away, faster and faster. As a result, these option holders will likely start to sell their calls, which then means the market maker that held stock against those calls will then sell that stock. When the options volume is high, this has a pronounced effect as resistance. If there is news or some other reason for these call option holders to resist selling, then this can propel the stock further do to increased delta hedging as the stock price runs past the strikes. Lately, there hasn‚Äôt been much enthusiasm to hold these calls."
"there's actually plenty of reviews, but on chinese websites, and to search them, you need to type chinese keywords in the search engine foe better results. a Google page translator helps. 

in my personal view, to do in-depth research on Nio, the first thing to do is filter out the anti-China bias, and just focus on the company and it's prospects. based on my preliminary research before i invested, I'd say there are 70% positive reviews and 30% neutral to negative reviews, with a margin of error of 5%. if you look from historical perspective, reviews were less positive in 2015-2017, a bit of skepticism, but the momentum shifted from 2018 onwards. 

started seeing more of these cars on the road after 2018, so i think prospects are good, I've been to China several times in the past few years for internships, in the past I've barely seen any in 2014 to 2017, now there's a lot more. and there are rebates buying these cars there due to being eco-friendly. anyway, this is just based on personal experience, not investment advice."
Waiting for the day they ship to Europe
"There aren't many Chinese people who use reddit, and its quite likely those that do arent also into stocks/or EVs. You'd be better off sourcing Chinese language reviews if you can."
I'll write a full review on here later. I drive between Suzhou & Shanghai and it's definitely getting more & more popular.
"in shanghai ,i everyday see o lot of nio es8 or es6,they are everywhere and very beautiful"
thanks for the awards!! ü§©
"Customer‚Äôs reviews are over local China media as well as YouTube but in Chinese language. Also, the NIO app provides a good source for getting the firsthand news as well as observe how NIO do among its car owners and potential owners. Unfortunately, now the app has not offered other languages yet. From what I been on recently, the community vibe on the app is very vibrant. I can share more photos and videos from the app if these are welcomed here."
I have one but I'm scared some one might steal it if I show them
Are there any photos of Uyghurs driving NIO?
I haven't seen some yet but will make sure to snap a pick if I do.
Thank you !! This is the kind of feedback I think we need more of . More about the product instead of the daily stock price. Did you happen to step in a NIO house?
"Have you come across any EC6 reviews worth sharing, I feel this vehicle will soon be their best seller and being the latest hopefully worked most all of the kinks out. Watched a couple European driver reviews in early days and they had a few issues. Also Nomi is really an interesting feature . Hopefully gets more advanced w every model and updates."
Which model are you getting?
"Good to know, thanks"
True! I live in Shanghai too. So many NIOs all around
I think that would be excellent!! Thanks
Good point. I‚Äôve thought about this more than once. Not into supporting the CCP. Hopefully a company like NIO - something positive/  w a brilliant young CEO will help make the world a little better . Pretty sure my I phone was made there also and most of my car parts and the tools I‚Äôm using today. Idk ...I try to be a conscious consumer but probably could do better. Needless to say it‚Äôs definitely something to think about.
Do you see poor blacks driving Tesla?
"if you're talking about the one in beijing, i didn't go, bcuz to be honest, at that time, my level of interest wasn't that high. i just started taking a serious look into Nio in terms of investment only early this year. 

when i first spotted Nio, it was on an online chinese news article about new eco-friendly technology. sorry to say this now but initially i thought it was a sham so didn't pay too much attention to it until i started spotting the cars on the road. and no it's not a sham, at least as of now, this company is very much legit. 

I'm going to keep paying attention to these chinese reviews and other related news bcuz it's kinda firsthand info, since by the time a news story reaches North America, it's probably already old news."
He's still deciding
"While we are waiting, wich one do you want? ^^"
hah\~happy
Perhaps you could think about BLM as well if you aren‚Äôt a hypocrite
Wtf kind of equivalency are you suggesting?
"NIO will be going to Europe first, by the time NIO comes out to US, I would hope the EVE has already come out üòè"
The kind that causes violent and deadly protests in the US
"HQ is in San Jose, CA. Waiting for Trump to leave the office so Trump can stop cutting ties with China in every aspect, or else NIO continues to be a sitting duck ü¶Ü. Then comes a NIO factory and battery exchange stations... OOOH so much to look forward to!"
I guess that‚Äôs better than enslaving people for their religious beliefs.
Sure if you think murdering people in public is ok
I like NIO stock.
"Yes, he/she needs to go but so do the ‚Äúwhat price will we see today guys!?‚Äù people, too."
"Yeah it‚Äôs annoying af, I was going to tell mod to warn/ban"
Drumming up biz for his utube channel
I am more interested to see how many videos he/she can put out in a 24 hr period..
"I hate this new era of automated shit. It probably just pulls from news and companies balance sheets, the key words do images searches and makes the video automatically. If you can pull thousands of them for lots of different stocks you'll make serious money, even if each video doesn't get a huge number of views.

Simply wallstreet do the same thing with their articles, nobody actually writes them and they're really poor quality and rarely have context

I really hope this shit doesn't take off"
"It‚Äôs literally all weeks old aswell, the videos you want are Courtside Financial on NioGlobal, much more relevant and informative videos"
"Yes, all to his YouTube channel."
I just blocked him. Just let me know if he ever posts something newsworthy. Haha.
Some are old news. Very much spamming for views and not serious with NIO.
"Wow. Do you really think a freaking bot created the article and vid editing?
If that's the case I applaud the developer of the bot, good for him creating such a bot. Too bad for us humans that can't discern between artificially generated hollow articles, vs humanly curated and debated articles."
"Yeah Courtside Financial has decent videos, I never remove those. I don't think he has posted in a while, I'll look into that."
"DONGXii - the china opportunity. He's the best. Courtside is decent too, I watch his stuff now and then"
"He posts them on NioGlobal, just repost them into here coz they‚Äôre pretty useful vids imo."
Pre-market up 3.88% (time of post) finally a good sign after the news from the past week?
Depressing how tied to Tesla this is. Will it ever be in its own lane? Its starting to piss me off.
Cut the damn chord already..  Nio needs to stretch it legs and walk away from Tesla
"I think everyone‚Äôs going to think this is the bottom of the the dip, and will buy straight away."
I have a Jan 15 call at 17$. NIO to the moonüìàüìà
"There's a ton of OI at the $18c, $19c, and $20c weeklies... the stock is having a tough slog as these folks are getting hammered with dropping premiums."
couldn't be happier with the $18 dollars a share. I'm dancing :-)
I wonder if it will dump on open or keep going up. I‚Äôm waiting 30 minutes before buying for sure
Please be red :)
"I am not sure. I‚Äôve seen many times pre-market in green, only for everything to go red after opening"
Same...considering all nio have achieved recently.
For real

Why the shameee
Too many dam short sellers rn.
What‚Äôs the basic translation and what model is this? All I understood was bye bye ...
Damn bro pick up your fucking feet
"Hey everyone check out my nio es6. It can swap batteries but we‚Äôre not going to do that today, instead we‚Äôre going to a charging station. 

Hello everyone here I am at the charging station, ok let‚Äôs use the app. Oh look a QR code reader to pair my car to the station. 

Here we are charging my car. Ooh look at the fancy computer screen. 

Ok everyone it‚Äôs charged now, thank you bye bye"
Nio needs to solve its production capacity problem sooner rather than later imo.
"Remember, we are dealing with Assembly line and there's going to be efficiency of product on top of the raw optimal number. If they are expecting an average efficency of 83%, that's not bad, if Quality standards are maintained.

If they push just for numbers, there's a higher risk of defects and quality issues. That's not what they want for a 'Community'/'Lifestyle' centric marketing they're going for."
"I wish it were possible, but I think you're wrong. It's been detailed everywhere the last two months that they will have a production capability of 5000 max per month, starting this month."
"NIO doesn't have a production capacity problem. It's a new company, taking a steady approach to their growth. At the end of the day, do you think Li Bin, an investor and CEO of NIO himself, would put his company in a position not to become profitable? I doubt it."
"Those issues existed when they were completing 15 jobs per house. Completing a Job suggests that any issues were handled.
So the increase from 15 jobs to 20 jobs per hour indicates an increase of 5 Vehicles extra produced per hour"
"Thats a rather asinine statement, saying that just because every ceo wants the company to profit therefore he or she definitely wouldnt make decisions that would be detrimental to the business. Some ceos may think they are making the right decisions when they are not.

Speaking of production, you do realise they face bottleneck issues? Not to mention nio is trying to expand rapidly."
"At 15 jobs, their best delivery month was ~3750 which was in June. The 3965 in August was likely not achieved on 15 jobs as they were already transitioning to 20 jobs.

With 3750 at 15 jobs, it is sensible to assume they can manufacture approximately 5000 at 20 jobs. But not much more.

Nevertheless, I also suspect that September deliveries will likely exceed 5,000 because of the EC6s that were made in Aug for September delivery. However, September delivery will be a one-off imo."
"if they are expanding rapidly why would they even think they are not solving bottleneck issues? Obviously if a CEO didn't point it out, someone will -- it is too obvious to miss."
"I don't see it as a foolish comment at all lol. I also don't see having a few thousand on back order as a production capacity problem either. Li Bin understands with Covid still around, and possible (forced) shut downs still possible, I don't see any real changes to production until there is a cure, only upgrades and second shifts to current facilities."
They have other business segments as well
Few thousand not a problem? I see your logic now.

Does Robin hood work in the UK????

"I second Trading 212, hadn't heard of NIO before I had a play on there in June"
"Ok nice, I'll check it out. Thanks"
"Revolut is not broker, but its not bad if you wanna hold short-mid term. I am using revolut  for better exchange courses and e wallet ( working i Norway and being from Czech). I am holding some stocks there ( just before i move my money to my home account) , its better than just having money staying there."
"Ah because it's a very simplistic app, and I have all my invested money there. They're not a real broker so I can't transfer my shares to anywhere else. That's the part that stresses me out.  


Apart from that the app is pleasant to use I'll admit, I wish it was more complete and had options."
Will check these out aswell thanks
"I did actually realise that I couldn‚Äôt transfer coins when I was buying crypto but when it came to buying shares, I had to sign up to a brokerage and wait for them to accept my application. Haven‚Äôt tried to move them anywhere yet though. Thanks for the replies!"
"We need to stop being jerks towards new or inexperienced people. Were all on the same rocket. Im not experienced myself I only started investing in April. My goal is mid to long term. So what that means is stop checking your damn portfolio every second because it will eat you alive. Second, I forgot which date when unemployment was through the roof and the stock market was in the green it literally made no sense. So that was my conclusion to stop trying to understand the market and instead just cruise control it

Edit: my grammar is atrocious at 10am in the morning"
Lol how long have you been investing for? Obviously not long? Can‚Äôt expect just because of your own diligent research of good news and factual reports with an increased volume/revenue that stocks will go up . If that was the case multiple stocks would never go down . Plus NIO stock is a MEME stock for many option traders so it‚Äôs extremely volatile + you add on this crazy 2020 and elections with trump and there you have it.
"What do you mean? It‚Äôs up in premarket right now, and it really didn‚Äôt drop all that far. The whole markets been hit."
because they r trying to catch people's shares
Pro America anti China interests artificially keeping price down
"Don‚Äôt listen to these haters üòÇ all I see is hate, not even advice."
"Oops , was multitasking and mixed my words up. Appreciate the correction, dont want to lead someone down the wrong path"
"For the past 3 months, I noticed that everytime we have good news, NIO will drop or decrease a bit. If there‚Äôs no news, it increases on it‚Äôs own. No news is good news for NIO. Idk why but it‚Äôs been a pattern. 


Just answering why it‚Äôs down... It‚Äôs been going down since the crash last week so give it some time to consolidate this week or two. I would use this opportunity to pick up low stock prices and sell off when it hits to 19-20, which I have the confidence that it will reach that peak again. I wouldn‚Äôt be worried if NIO drops to $10 because it had a good track record of jumping back to high 20s with lots of future plans ahead of NIO. Patience is what kills me lol


Overall, NIO is fits best for a long-term investment. Buy lots of low, sell high on the way. Unless you have thousands to buy/sell on the same day with a 50cents gain, then sure it‚Äôs understandable. Just be wary of US presidential election on Nov.3, TUES.


Edit: Here‚Äôs a [Youtube Video by Graham](https://youtu.be/UkIAsYWgciQ) that you can learn about the crash and how it made (bear) traders react. Easy understanding and good research."

"If you're looking for predictability the stock market is the wrong place, Logic?  Not much of that either..... You'll get used to it"
Thanks for the advice! It wasn't hate or something I'm just trying to know the market :) this is my first investment I'm holding this longterm because it seems like a good company to me. Anyways I think this stuff is really interesting but I have alot to learn still and need to get some more experience

Okay thanks :)
Thanks :))

Why tho I'm just interested I'm trying to learn but okay guess you can remove my post
"It was from that Initial rocket from 2-10$ 
Always top 3 day traded on RH . I think the stock is far from just a meme stock now. Solid fundamentals with promising outlook with growth overseas and bass"
It‚Äôs literally up 8% right now. Can you just be patient? People expect instant gratification nowadays and it‚Äôs hella fucking annoying.
"There was a literally a market crash, and you're asking why Nio is going down? Surely youre trolling?"
Oh damn your right. Anyways its not that I'm not patient this is my first investment I got this when it was a 14. I don't care if it drops 100% it's just that im interested in how this stuff exactly works I thought nio would be decent first investment and I'm want to hold this long term
This is my first investment ever I'm just trying to learn it wasn't hate against nio or something:(
"lol, the whole point of this subreddit is to share what we know and bounce ideas. Hop off"
You picked a good first investment.
Suck my muslim balls.
Idiot Trump
I think other banks will follow suit over time and yeah trumps actually a very stupid man
Get out while you still can. Stock is gonna go back down to $12.
Wanna bet on it
"I‚Äôm actually pretty confident with holding because I know NIO can get back up to at least 17.5 to 20. If it drops to 12, it‚Äôs a buying opportunity! üéâ"
I don‚Äôt agree with $12 but I do think $14-15 is coming
Shanghai has one in NIO Space.
it is beautiful
"Technically you would still own the shares. I think they‚Äôd be held by your broker or they would send some certificates to you. You‚Äôd have to sell them offline, so to speak. In the old days, for small companies that didn‚Äôt qualify to be on an exchange, brokers would call each other up and sell shares that way. I‚Äôd imagine it would be something similar. I could be wrong, though.

A share is a slice of ownership in the company. The exchange just makes it easier to buy and sell those shares. Delisting just means the exchange won‚Äôt let those shares be traded there, the same way a shopping mall could ban McDonalds from doing business in their mall. But it doesn‚Äôt affect McDonalds per se. People that like McDonalds just need to go elsewhere to buy their stuff.

Dont know what ASX is and no one trades on there so no worries here
Maybe ask your broker. They will be able to provide an answer.
im sure it will be easy for NIO to list in China or HK? or not?
what broker are you using?
"Less than 2 months before the election, expect all the volatility to happen. I am gonna sit tight and enjoy the ride."
What is ASX?
"Kiwi here. Hmm, I feel like NIO is too popular to be delisted? There are many random Chinese stocks that were listed which had vague operations. I have invested through Hatch, who buys directly off the NYSE though"
Idiot Trump doesn't know that he shall not do that because He would be failure.
"I don't understand your logic. What is your point exactly? 

Are you afraid or something? Are you looking for like, someone to tell you it will be okay?"
"Yeah I‚Äôve read about the selling offline just didn‚Äôt know how that would work as I‚Äôm a strong believer in nio and will hold on for years I just need to start prepping if that is the case to try and find to keep is somewhere if it‚Äôs not on the nyse, thanks for the link üí™üèº"
"Australian Stock Exchange, presumably."
Stake which is through sanlam private
Yeah I don‚Äôt plan on selling for 3-5 years üöÄ
Australian stock exchange
Not at all because no one fuckn knows im just asking what happens if it gets delisted.
"Thanks for the clarification, yeah I‚Äôm talking about the Australian Stock Exchange. I know you can‚Äôt even buy NIO from there but I trade both in Australia and the U.S and the ASX dropped about 25 mill in Chinese listings today"
"Same, they don‚Äôt trade on asx so nothing happens in your shares. The move might drive Aussie traders away though"
"I have a pretty solid idea of what's going to happen. Would you like some advice from me, or should we continue panicking?"
Lol
This sub is flooded with broke bears and bots and I fucking loooooooooove it. :-)
Today is the day of reckoning! üöÄüöÄ
Premarket isn't looking so good right now.

Why today ?
Looks like this is what we needed to detach nio from tesla. Nio holding up surprisingly strong
"TSLA‚Äôs bringing down the sector, albeit not as badly as Friday. Insane how one massively overvalued company can do that."
$25üöÄ
"TSLA and AAPL might see a little more pullback, there‚Äôs talk of money rotating to non-tech, but I don‚Äôt see much further downside on NIO. I could be wrong, but I‚Äôm hoping for a bounce back week."
"Oh god, here we go again..."
Nio lands new bull rating from Deutsche Bank https://seekingalpha.com/news/3612010-nio-lands-new-bull-rating-from-deutsche-bank
All good news and being dragged down by Tesla and others. Will these good news be worth anything after this mess?
Do you think the US presidential election will affect stocks in general? Affect NIO?
We are going to dip to $12-$13 when market opens. No way we will go to the moon today. If sh*t really hits the fan we are going to see <$10 this week. Will be good time to load up hard.
"Lol, careful there. Could see correction this week."
üöÄ
Thats not just Nio though
Maybe we need some bad news for it to rise üòÇ
I bought Tesla stocks when there were $480.... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yeah I think this gonna be a bad bad day..
rather be holding Nio than Tesla lol. Tesla down 16%...
GM  are trending down because EV's are taking over. GM practically acknowledged EVs are here to stay and are a very real option by partnering with Nikola. Can't put much more faith in a company than that. They also back them with like $2bn shares
"Imagine, Nio announces bankruptcy and it will reach $100 in minutes. Atleast it seems so, that positive news will tank the stock and maybe negative ones make it rocket hahaha"
"Everyone thinks it because of the Monday hype, sure its gonna rocker to 18/18.50 but I‚Äôm afraid of another dip there."
Looking forward to the day Nio decouples from Tesla movements.
32
I share your opinion. Further pullback on the large cap companies makes sense but I don't see it effecting Nio.
It will my friend
More and more institutions are turning bullish towards NIO. I think it's largely being dragged by overall market and the hesitation on Trump's anti-China escalation. Suspect NIO will come out stronger after those subside.
"The US presidential election (to my knowledge) will most definitely affect stocks. I think no matter who wins, we should expect a dip of some sort."
No way do we go sub $10 Tho I think your spot on with 12-13 if shit hits the fan. I‚Äôm going to buy more if it dips below 15. üöÄüöÄüöÄ
"I'll be damned. Nio is holding strong. I think this really says something. We are not overpriced atleast, or what? Lovely, let's keep on rollin'. Slow and steady."
spot on . 10 not possible. 13 probably
Meant to reply to this earlier but got distracted. I honestly dont think we'll go below 15 again.
Shhhhh your ruining my wishful thinking.
"Given the direction the stock has taken for recent positive news about them, you just might be right."
"Hold, it's a total meme stock. Will balloon again, then sell."
"bought a single stock at 445$ and i feel your pain (I'm a student, all i could afford)"
GM were given the shares I believe as a payment.... but the main guy of the original SPAC used to be GM ceo I believe.... dont get me wrong I'm happy about this...just annoyed nio doesnt get the same reaction from the marketüòÇ....I want  both up
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ....so true.
Dip would be nice!
Same..
I think we are seeing the first steps of that today.
"Well, Nov. 3 is the day to look out for üëÄ"
Isn't Day of Reckoning supposed to be a bad thing?
"Hahaha meme stock? Many people are this as a serious ""competitor"" to Tesla :O

I'm honestly thinking to buy 200 more"
"I bought 22 stocks :(

At this point I would be more than happy if I also bought a single stock.... :("
True.
I meant that TSLA is a meme stock
"Hold for the long run my dude, everything will work out üëç"
"Ahhh hahaha at the moment, yea it is! Lost a lot of money because of Tesla... But I won't sell my Tesla stocks when it's this low. I will just wait until it goes up again. Who know it might go up again a bit after the battery day :)

But I think I will buy like 200 more NIO stocks when it's still at $17. It might go up to $25 soon :o"
"For Tesla, it will probably hype up before the battery day and then dip a bit, who knows what will happen after the battery day. Elon is known to make it a bit awkward and mess something up, but he is just a human. Many people were expeting Tesla to announce 1mil battery, some heard, they will announce 1k mile range battery? These are so different topics that who knows how it will actually affect the stock. It may tank even harder. 

Nio is totally a buy stock for sure, I am expecting a lot from them. Maybe +$30 EOY. Who knows, eh? It may literally spike up every moment if some more investors would turn their heads towards Nio. Constant good numbers on sales, expanding globally, BaaS, good Ceo.... Only down side is, it's a chinese company and many investors don't want to put money there or are sceptical towards their numbers.."
"Yeah I know such as his Twitter status when he wrote that Tesla stocks costs too much... He screwed so.ma y that day since it dipped hardüòÇüòÇ

I also believe in NIO go be honest. I really hope we that $30+ very soon, that would be great, for both us and them! Yeah I know that Chinese companies is a sceptical market, but I'm also worried that Xpeng might overcome them since they are backed by Alibaba :/

I'm still figuring out whether to invest my stocks in NIO or in Xpeng..."
"Why not both, I mean, if EVs blow up, they both will"
"I want to believe me, the thing is that I kinda went ""all in"" on Tesla (which I now regret)... But I have like $3k left to spend.

So far I have like 200 NIO and 50 Xpeng. F√∂r 3k i can get either another 200 stocks on NIO or 200 or Xpeng... This is my dilemma right now :P"
Go 50/50 :)
"Yea I might do that, or maybe just spend everything on NIO since they are ""bigger"" atm"
Nio hitting $40 EOW confirmed
$25.00 EOW and $40.00 EOY
They only show Tesla cars and service centers. They didn't show anythin NIO. Hmmmm

[Source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.kiplinger.com/investing/601348/is-the-stock-market-closed-on-labor-day-2020%3famp) Normal hours resume on Tuesday. Happy Labor Day!


Edit: Closed for entire labor day. Oops sorry guys."
Huge announcement next week from Nio whatever happens this week I‚Äôd recommend everyone buy Friday whatever you can.
"All nio needs is just one more quarter and they will exploded   


[One more quarter and Nio stock will explode](https://youtu.be/hpN_1a-IPtI)"
Jeeez man good luck
The fact that nobody refuted this shows how new everyone here is to the markets. It was even upvoted multiple times.  Just an interesting observation..
"Thanks for the link I was wondering what the hours would be, but from that table it looks like labor day is closed all day for all markets"
"Frankfurt is green! ^GDAXI ‚Ç¨13,100.28 (+2.01%) on Yahoo Finance https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGDAXI?p=%5EGDAXI"
Tell us more?
Thanks!
"Yeah, just saw this post now. It's our day off."
You were right üëçüèª
Indeed but on a side note I see the days leading up to battery day being good for us and tesla. Since the stock definitely follows tesla to some degree. Plus labor day hype I know I'm looking to snag some stocks that are on discount rn.
" If I were you I'd be closing the trade as soon as you get to break even, hopefully Tuesday/Wednesday. Theta will kill you otherwise"
Battery day is also the same day EC6 starts deliveries
Theta is only $6 a day for the 9/11 $20 call not too bad.
Expect next months numbers to be even better then!
Better hop on the rocket
Yup I sold my shares when we hit $33 expecting a correction. Didn't buy any on the dip since I had no free money. Hoping it doesn't go to $26 by eow would be higher then my previous avg lol.
Whoops replied to the wrong comment haha.
"Increasing delivery is great for the short run, but I really hope they don't sacrifice their superb quality control and end up being like Tesla."
"question, what is Double Shift? Is it related to supply chain?"
"Is the title of this thread incorrect? Did you want to say September? 
This is confusing as August deliveries were confirmed and you also mention them in your post."
"Regardless, stock will go down. I have absolutely ZERO idea what is keeping this stuck under $25/share. Fucking Nikola is trading at $50, Nikola lol. I might put 10k tomorrow to try and catch a quick 10% swing and make some weekend money.

But Nio will either keep going down, slowly, over the next 2-5 months. Or, it will have its Tesla moment and just BOOM.

Mind you, we need to remember that NIO is up hundreds of %'s this year which could play into the price for the remainder of the year. But still!"
"Only deliveries matter, orders can be cancelled.

I don't doubt that they have more order than they can produce at the moment but they seriously need to ramp up production."
"Lemme tell you, I sat in a Tesla *years* ago, before I knew what trading was, before I had heard about Nio, and I *still* thought the quality was poor: oversized steering wheel, too spartan interior, mediocre seat feel, poor material quality, and (in the X) the floor height made me feel like I was almost sitting in the fetal position. At this point I just want to see these guys have some decent competition, which I feel is inevitably coming."
"Currently NIO employs one 10 hour shift to produce its current monthly capacity which is expected to rise to 5000 in September. Company has stated the potential to have a double shift -- TWO 10 hours shifts in a day at the same assembly. That would of course double production capacity to 10,000. When you double capacity you need to double all the components in building the NIO vehicles. That will require coordination with NIO suppliers who are NIO's supply chain"
"My educated guess is having the factory run double shifts instead of the current 12 hour run it does each day. So it would operate 24 hours with 2 sets of workers, in theory doubling capacity!"
"No the numbers are estimates of Orders received in August. So I am estimating NIO got 8,000 in Orders in August which they will deliver in September & later Versus the 3965 vehicles they delivered in August"
How does NIO increase its production capacity in the first place?
Got it!
So 235m/3.50 SP about 67m additonal shares? Currently about 1.2b shares o/s so maybe around a 5% drop
Someone‚Äôs been taking the yahoo finance board to seriously
"it is already burned news.( any way it is good news Raising cash via private placements has some advantages for businesses. For one, it requires no public filings and is easier to execute. The bonds are offered at a fixed rate and the purchaser can remain confidential.)"
""" subject to certain adjustments  "" can we find out what this is?"
He did the math
Is that actually how it works?
"Yes, if the market was rational"
Dang the dash board looks sick. What model is it?
"Hello from Vancouver, Jin An is my home 2"
"It  looks nice , I hope It would be Available in US one day."
"Amazing!! I see a very bright future in upcoming months and years . 

Ps. The photo is like in a anime. Haha, but like i said its really amazing what Nio is achieving now."
"Are the screens really dirty or is the plastic wrap still on them?

Really cool photo btw"
what kind of car is that???
"I agree, it oozes future"
Dirty
pretty sure plastic wrap is still on
I have lot riding on NIO stock and I am in it for the long haul. hoping it goes up big time soon.
Going to be some choppy trading. I am long also. Wouldn't mind grabbing a few hundred shares in the 15-16 range.
"It will, and I'm buying Tuesday while it's still low."
Could be good news. It got editors pick if that means anything.
Might give a slight bump up to stock prices?  Having a face behind the name.  If youre new to NIO anyways.
adorable man make me rich üòäüòò
Hell yes
Excellent
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but can‚Äôt nio vehicles use tesla chargers?
Nooo I need it to drop more so I can invest more. This doesn't help me lol
best CEO in the fucking world
There are 17 of him
"What if he was just William Li.

The number of fucking retards hoping Nio is the next Tesla is absolutely cringey."
Yup always helps to be more transparent. Especially with a big name like Forbes. Hopefully all this positive NIO news hits the mainstream soon.
"I don‚Äôt have an answer to that question. If anything, there might be a need for an adaptor. On a fun note, [Tesla can also use NIO‚Äôs charging services.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/equalocean.com/news/201904211840/amp)"
Name checks out.
"Please someone ban this guy from this subreddit. 


He just trolls and he's clearly broke or too rich to do anything else with his time.


 Whatever he is, at its base it is negative and disrespectful.

 He is rude. 

It is annoying.

 
That is all I have to say."
They can‚Äôt swap batteries
"Original comment, quite a thinker you are"
"Right

And retards constantly posting rocket ships and saying nio is the next tesla are better."
Not batteries. A van will come over to wire charge you.
Well you are a big gay üêª should be a compliment.
"I don't know why you feel this anger and hatred. 

I don't know why you use the R word so loosely. 

I don't know who you are.

I don't know anything about you.

And I hope the best for you and your loved ones and I hope you see things more positively tomorrow than you did yesterday.

You can always be kinder.

Have a good day. ‚ù§"
Tesla does that too?
"No, burn him at a stakeüî•"
For NIO? Idk
This is fine as well
in at 162 shares with a $12 cost basis and i'm in it for the long haul.
"this is at least for 5 months asset , fluctuations doesn't work on it. This price even 30$ would be dream"
"Agreed. Although this company's stock can be very profitable for day- and swingtraders, it's a pretty safe bet long term. The only real question is will it be a 30% return or 100%, or more?

Time will tell."
"NIO is trying (and doing well) at becoming a typical brand people would have at home, yet luxurious and progressive. Remember that NIO doesn‚Äôt have mini vans YET, so that‚Äôs one of many potential it has for the future."
"How can people upvote such a post impossible to read.

Tips :Double enter for spacing on mobile."
17.00
"162 with a $12 costs? Nice! It's almost $18 now! :D

Are you planning to buy more is do you stop there? :)"
Good price to buy in at üòâ
[deleted]
"Thanks! Planning to round out at about 300 shares, but maybe more. I wanna hold long ...and I‚Äôm doing my DD I keep seeing more and more reasons why Nio is an Incredible company. Let the short term holders get scared and sell their shares to me üëçüëçüëç"
Yes!
What the fuck are you talking about?
The thing is that I'm afraid that Xpeng will overcome NIO and become the more superior between these two... So I don't know if I should keep buying a few more NIO or buy Xpeng instead :/
I thought you were talking shit about the price. Guess I misread your comment. Have a good one.
"Ah, you too Good Sir."
"So many things can happen, no one knows exactly what and why, and when. I think you should remember that the market is a combination of big institutional investors and many smaller fish who undergo large emotional mood swings. FOMO and greed are dominating our investor psychology and these emotions combined with the many risks, opportunities and uncertainties of the future, create sometimes strong volatility.  

Long story short: it can go up and it can go down. It can be a bloodbath or a party for invested capital. It can also move sideways. 

A couple things are at play right now in relation to Nio: we have a global pandemic, Tesla has had a large run up, new EV manufacturers (from China) are entering the market, Chinese stocks might become delisted from Nasdaq, Nio is coming to Europe, Nio is doing great on paper, Nio is giving out new shares and creates (small) dilution for current investors, Tesla wasn't included in S&P 500, the Nasdaq is currently going down (correction or beat down?)... I'm forgetting a lot, please help me expand on this list...

So...

I'm sorry but I don't know, what do you think is going to happen?"
"Nio stock listed on NYSE not nasdaq , and every thing is perfect in this company, the best CEO, earnings and deliveries. The price expect to be $25 before the end of 2020 , the stock ranked 2 on zack analysts (buy). Just hold it and forget. And my advice.. don‚Äôt listen to anyone just do you research and you will find the answer."
What happens if NIO gets delisted from Nasdaq?  Do we just get back the current share price we all have invested?
"Thanks for the answer. Im really a newbie, nio is my first investment. I just Saw some guys saying it's going to fall on Tuesday not sure if they were just trolling."
Have you seen its balance sheet?
"Its not happening, and you will know that months in advance."
Nio is ADR stock listed on NYSE.
I hope it does i need some more share at a discount üôè
"I think the same. Have only 100 shares, and would like to have 1k at least!"
How many shares you got?
"Im on 150.. would also like to buy more. I made a big mistake.. nio was on 12$ and i kept thinking if it goes down a little more ill buy, and then it went Up to 19 big L for me. Bought it at 19 still Better than nothing."
English subtitles would be nice
good thing there's subtitles
"It seems that Nio is really high quality car. The interior of Nio looks much nicer and more valuable than Tesla in my opinion. 

btw this all black Tesla looks pretty sick"
"The reviewer likes the front cargo and technology of tesla like the doors and autonomous features. He said tesla is more responsive while nio controls are smoother. The interior quality and roominess of nio is better than tesla. If he had to pick between the two he would go for Tesla for the technology but if tech is not very important for the buyer, then Nio‚Äôs lower price is makes it the better choice."
"Can‚Äôt follow the Mandarin and no English subtitles. 
Don‚Äôt even understand what I just watched"
That front passenger leg rest is legendary
"Thanks, All into gnus, thx for the tip."
Is this a snuff film?
Yea probably won't affect the stock price since no one can understand üòÖ.
"he gave a review on the twilight book series, if you want to know."
"I mean, there are actually plenty of nio test drives and reviews in English on YouTube. But this is a direct comparison to the model x so it would‚Äôve been nice to see in English. But if you search on YouTube there are swap station https://youtu.be/t1Ld5WByT34 videos, nio house https://youtu.be/yuefu8Tls1I videos, es 6 es 8 videos https://youtu.be/dMaddpdP9UU but I haven‚Äôt seen a comparison like this"
Can someone explain what this means?
"We have a strong reversal pattern but good nio news overall very difficult to predict what will happen especially with the market drop we had lately.

We also have plenty of investors waiting and looking for a dip not chasing the market. strong buy will happen at some point just like Friday.

Anyone who bought before the 24th August should be fine. The others who bought at the top id say sell and follow what happens many might not be able to hold their positions if it keeps dropping"
"Most of these are held by Tencent and Li himself, but still, thought it was useful info."
I expect more dramatic price drops whenever NIO stock price surges so that the holders of the convertible notes can maximize gains when they can buy the shares at $3.50
This is from March??
Seconded. I don‚Äôt really understand what notes are - what are the short term implications ?
"Yup I'm honestly so excited for Tuesday. If we see another drop to lets say $15.50. Then it picks back up again and passes $18 EOD. I wanna say its gonna be a green week if the market as a whole does good next week then almost guaranteed with all good news recently following NIO. 


Kinda random but historically after a late labor day 9/07 the markets are green. Which is just superstition but a interesting fact."
These convertible notes are owned by unaffiliated Asia-based investment funds. The one you are referring to was issued on 5 Sep 2019.
So they should go up after the 5th?
Agreed. I‚Äôd like to think they wouldn‚Äôt dump the notes straight away.
"Anyone that has any can buy more shares at the stated price - this one being $3.50. Short erm implications? Probably 0, as the notes are owned mostly by Tencent and Li. So I don‚Äôt see them using them atm. But potentially could act the same way as stock dilution.. as more shares would be bought at 3.50, this could bring the current stock down.. but like I said, probably not gonna happen anytime soon"
"That price is so low - when would these investors logically be using these notes to acquire shares at the $3.50 price? Once the price of the stock has appreciated further? 

What‚Äôs the benefit of waiting even? Why not just access those cheap shares now?"
Isn't this a good thing for us? Means there's more interest from investors to get into this company. And they probably wanna wait for the share price to go up before cashing in. But the worrying thing is the offering is for so cheap and he's already diluted the stock last month albeit for $17 when it was around $22. I can see it going up from interest or crashing from panic.
"Well most of the owners of these notes are big investors in the company and want to see it succeed, it is in their interest to wait for the sp to be higher before cashing in. Better for their investment and better for profit gain."
"Uhh, thoughts on next week? Not asking for predictions.. How do you just feel about the upcoming week? Will we hit $15-$16 again? Or even $14? Market is bonkers. I am buying every dip we get."
I‚Äôm wondering how those 3.50 notes are going to play out.
Guessing sideways $17~$19. Seems supported both on the resistance & support sides
17.00 holding strong. Think I fell for not a scam is good too.
"Plz go down more, I need to load UP more shares"
I am an investor in Nio and I love its stocks
"No it‚Äôs back up from here, that was the correction."
"I would bet on an overall bearish movement after a spike bull in the morning. Turn your graphs to 4HR interval and you‚Äôll see a bearish ‚ÄúM.‚Äù Probably up to $14-$15, I might be wrong (it‚Äôs stocks, we‚Äôre potentially wrong anyways and I‚Äôm NOT experienced) but that‚Äôs what I think."
"I bet it will hit 20 on Monday.
My only concern is to daytrade NIO or just let it grow."
What makes you think so?
"So I did the math like a üêí added and subtracted all the shares bought and sold from after it hit its high of $20.94. People sold 102.11m worth of shares, but bought 83.35m so we only need 17.76m shares to get back to that price. We avg 51cents higher for the week, while tesla is down $52.55. So after profit taking and weak hands we still went positive on a weekly basis. I'm thinking we at least see $19 by Thursday. Would like to get your opinion on this üòâ. 

TLDR- NIO only needs 17.76m shares to get back to $20.90."
Wishful thinking. And im inclined to believe him
"Market fundamentals, general profile of investor (institutional), strong company profile. Some stocks like Zoom are likely to take a further hit or at least take a severe dip in momentum. Barring some really disruptive external event, companies with a reasonable valuation are going to come back very quickly. A good buy is a good buy."
I need a lecture video to learn about this lol learning new things every day. Thanks for your input!!
"hopefully it drops further to 15, want to invest moreüòÖ"
"I somehow perfectly timed my buy and got more at 16.80 and bought enough that I'm net positive now, despite only buying in a week ago"
"It's staying strong above 17$ with much more volume, I take it as a positive.

It's just a healthy retracement before Tesla SP500 inclusion that will send all EV stocks to the moon again"
"Well, at least it's a good time to pick up some more. It will go back up eventually."
17.00!
"Something weird is happening with the whole market. I closed all my positions and I‚Äôm waiting with cash. 

Markets might be trashed until elections"
I would've said that last week but I bit too early and bought some yesterday. Holding out now with no more funds and it's painful
Lets hope so.  Bought 20 shares of Tesla and have been sitting on 500 shares of Nio for a while.
Ouch. This comment aged well.
[deleted]
time will heal the woundsüòâ
Did exactly the same but sold all my average Microsoft shares so I can buy the dip. When I start selling mega tech e.g Microsoft into nio you know I‚Äôve got a problem üöÄüöÄ
"$200k at 19.90.. Trust me, this dip could end up costing me a bit lol. Long term, prob 30-50k. That's why people say if you are INVESTING, invest systematically. Money/Time. Even if it goes up or down. $200k? Spread it over 20 trading days, etc/"
"Saying that I'm all out and 100% Tesla now with the dip.

Upside of 30%+ when the news drops. It was at 536$ premarket 3 days ago after all."
Market manipulation is stronger than my speculation indeed.
"And what‚Äôs your response if next week everything drops even lower?
 

Look at spy, it closed its 30 min candle back in the channel from prior to the break out. Looks like a fairly large correction which will pull back stock price and keep them from rising back to their recent highs for a little bit"
Didn‚Äôt stay down long enough for me to get in!
I wonder what it's like to even have that much money in the first place. Good luck
"Yeah my average is $430 so not great, but not too horrible"
"Hi all out and 100% Tesla now with the dip, I'm Dadüë®"
"I mean it still holds true though. If everyone‚Äôs going out, of course it‚Äôs going to drop. If it continues next week than it was a smart move but that‚Äôs exactly why it‚Äôs dropping."
[deleted]
"Same as having less. I made $100k investing over the last 3 months. Took my original 100 and added my profits and re invested ibto NIO after I cashed out. I'm mad because I should have split my purchase between several buying days, but hindsight, if the stock went up, I would have ""missed out on money"". If the stock goes down,""I would have missed out on money."
"Compared to the price in 1 month, it's dirt cheap üòâ"
So if people are exiting the market then we‚Äôre agreeing? I don‚Äôt understand your point
Didn‚Äôt help today.
Buy. The. Dip
"Good thing about market crashes is they don't last long. Tesla is already -25% from all times high. We might get few more red days, but NIO is holding surprisingly well. Too bad good news on deliveries and price upgrade now doesn't mean nothing."
Whales are moving
Time to buy more and hold
It's matter of time these dips become big price increases. Just hold or buy more.
Lol. Dam.. should of came out earlier.
Thoughts on next week? Price?
"I know :( 
you got option(s) for this week?"
They don't mean nothing - I'm pretty sure NIO would be way more down if not for the positive sales numbers and target pr. upgrades.
"Yeah.. but IMO even they upgrade NIO earlier, it will still go down with the market. So hope this upgrade will make it go up next week."
up in the air tbh. we could see more profit taking and correction tuesday. hopefully correction so I can have more funds to buy more Nio. People don‚Äôt realize how big EV is gonna be. Everyone is focus on tesla and stock spilt shit
I have options that expire Friday:(
NIO is tied to Tesla and both are crashing atm. Also nio is only 3X from IPO price offering at 6.36 usd and Tesla is 100x more overpriced.
"Hi pretty sure NIO would be way more down if not for the positive sales numbers and target pr, I'm Dadüë®"
Do you now why the market dropped?
Same but sold it this morning. Hope this upgrade can help us next week.
Yup NIO really going down atm
My guess is correction and profit taking.
"It‚Äôs all riding on FAANG, Tesla and some other tech superstars which are stupid overpriced and due for a correction. In general the S&P is overpriced and the US economy is poopy. WSB are having a circlejerk"
you see it going up or down tomorrow
"Unfortunately down, what a shame that NIO is going down with the stock market with extraordinary August delivery number."
If you're a strong long term believer buy some LEAPS.
whoever bought 20p in the morning is making bank rn.
I can only jerk off so many times a day dude
"This is the content I follow this page for, not ‚Äòshould I buy‚Äô"
I would love to see NIO outside of China.
Amazing
"If they want to expand to Europe, English subtitle would be nice to reach out to a bigger audience."
Ren Shaoqing doing his magic. Checkout his publications. Has a CVPR best paper.
"All posts relating the the actual vehicles, such as this video, should use the post flair ""Vehicles"". You can sort by that to see similar posts."
I would say buy. this is a discount. imo next week we'll return to 20s
"you will get a lot of answers from a lot of people/idiots. reality is: no one knows the answer to your question

Hence 2 comments to this from my side
1) if you think something is cheap, buy it
2) if you believe in a company, time in market is more important than timing the market"
Don‚Äôt try to time the perfect price. Buy it and if it goes down then buy more.
"I loaded up even more, and netted $1000 on the swing which bought me discounted AAPL shares. Gotta love these days!"
I bought right at the first dip of the bell then it went down even lower
Wait til Tuesday
"i have two questions: is this truly the collapse of tesla? 

if so - does the collapse of Tesla outright wipe out the Chinese EVs?"
"Got another 100 shares 

Also buying microsoft and vym."
You should comment in daily post.
Nios first target is 27
Don't comment in daily post. New threads are more exciting. Keep buying.
Why my post get down votes!?
What to happen then?
"My guess is that it's not the collapse of Tesla, but a major correction.  They're still trading at well over 1000x p/e."
nah its not. just a correction for the tech market. look at nasdaq
China is the biggest ev market in the world
Sweetness! I bought more Appl. Got lucky and loaded the duck up on NIO back in February.
Buy today doesn‚Äôt matter
"Not the 1st time we pass a situation like this. Just remember when this exploded untill 20s. Be patiente and you will be taken to the fucking moon by NIO üöÄ 

Also: they got good numbers and got, once again, their price target updated (Credit Suisse: $25, if im not mistaken). Buy the dip!"
Uh il be honest. If youre like me whos here for the hype....this is the test of your hands. Fucking hang in there you morons the moon is just around the horizon
Well that was fun... not
I will be more than happy if it close around $18.5 today. That will fill me with optimism for next week.
Tech stocks as a whole are being hammered today.  This happens.  Stocks don‚Äôt just go up.  Stay. Calm.
And everyone who wanted a dip to buy in...here you go.
I predict today will be green. Way to many shorters both on NIO and Tesla. Stocks never go down and up from zero to hero and vice versa.
Shiiiit I only have 100 stocks...please NIO wait few weeks before going to the moonüôèüèø
This will be a good day despite the market not looking good. You cannot dispute the delivery numbers
Strangely high pre market volume on NIO? Showing 926.9k Volume per market? For comparison other stocks inhale like NVDA are only showing 64k. Thoughts?
Took my profits from $3.60 at $17.50. Will buy back in when this settles.
"That drop to 15ish was scary, oof"
"Is it because of the whole market? Nio was giving some good news and we are tanking like rest of the market, how far will this go.. Next week 14?"
Hold on to your seats everyone! Hoping for a soft landing!
"Well, we have a good climb in pre-h considering the AH close, will it be a green day? Will the good news actually overscale the overall market ""crash""? Are the good news what keeps us holding strong?"
Toooo the moooon
Really liking these call options I picked up yesterday ü§§
"20 shares at 18.18, oof so far today."
"I didn‚Äôt just double down, I doubled my double down. And it‚Äôs a third of my portfolio now."
"Hi not mistaken), I'm Dadüë®"
Yes - anyone who has been holding this stock for over a year - especially when it was in the low $1's & $2's will understand the volatility this stock experiences.
I hope you're rightüòÇüòÇüòÇ....     I was expecting nio to jump mid 20s after its announcement üòÇ
Done üòä bought higher as didn't thing this didp would happen...but taking advantage where I can!
let's goo hopefully got so many fkin calls
Options
"Yeah but if tesla goes down, so must nio"
They flooded the market to keep the price low so they don‚Äôt get over valued too quickly. Also so we on this sub can buy more
convertibles were actioned today i think?
I'm in uk and have cfds on them ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢üòÇ
"Ngl, barring the current dip, the market doesnt react as strongly (positively) to nio's good news as compared to say tesla."
"If it goes under 15 I'm pretty much gonna be forced to take out a loan. /s

Or am I."
"The whole market and TSLA‚Äôs downward momentum for the EV sector. Additionally, this doesn‚Äôt bode well that TSLA is the top stock for MTUM & ARKK etf‚Äôs lol. 

My model predicts sideways trading through till October which means that NIO would fluctuate between $17-$19, but it‚Äôs hard to say as we are currently in a volatile phase and there‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty. 

TLDR: Looking for an entry position/average down with a price of < $14. I know it seems unlikely, but this is just my personal view. Good luck to all! Still a good company with excellent prospects looking forward."
The dark side...
shut up
"I‚Äôm aware!

Lowest point I averaged down was 1.38 a share"
What announcement?
Good job report. Seems you are in luck
I‚Äôm very new to stock market...and know nothing about options and etc
Trust the fundamentals and buy the dip
"Ehh, that's just the name of the game. Tesla is an America Company on an American market who's successes are very tangible to the American audience."
Not yet ... we down
"When you buy an option, your buying the right to purchase the stock at a set price essentially. There‚Äôs a lot more to it then that. But it‚Äôs not super complicated if you read into it"
Then you should keep it simple.
Indeed hence why i explained goods news doesnt necessarily mean a boost in share price for nio. (Listing on a foreign exchange)
"Yeah, i sold my stocks. Dont think Tesla can hold 400."
I think the same...at the moment options are not for me.
sold all of nio? why?
I re-bought at 16. Just wanted to get more shares :) Seems like market prevailed
I see it falling further though unless next week tesla gets its shit together. But if tesla does not by the end of next week then nio will be around 14/13/15. Hate to say it. Long term obviously it will go up and up but just for short term.
Depends if tesla hold 400. Really depends how big this correction will be. Nio can be anywhere from 12 to 19 range.
I'm holding. Everyone thinks going to cruise ships and hotels ect. Is a good idea which it's not. Covid isn't going to be under control for a long time and winter is coming. These kinds of companies will probably fall harder and all you'll have is tech left in the end imo.
"This doesn‚Äôt change the fact that China is leading the way in going green in the automotive industry (surprisingly). Coupled with the fact that China‚Äôs wealth is in an upward trajectory and even has more rich people per capita than the US. It‚Äôs just the perfect time and place for this company to have success. Let‚Äôs not forget that they are working at full capacity or close to it. Go ahead and sell, if you‚Äôre a bitch. I‚Äôm sitting on my shares cause well I don‚Äôt have bills anyway."
"I bought in at $6 in the beginning of year. Still holding will continue to do so. 

Tesla won‚Äôt be the only EV company in the world competition is coming haha"
Block that fuckin dad bot lmao
 long term nio is a buy just the market is getting hit bad
It hurts holding how long will this bleeding last everything is red today could be even worse tomorrow
That's what she said
Why are we having a HOLD discussions over and over again whenever Nio dips... could someone explain the logic in this please?
"I‚Äôm starting to think most people here aren‚Äôt really long NIO. If you are, the only thing you should be thinking about during dips is buying, not selling."
Ban OP. No financial advices should be allowed.
Cruises and hotels profits were decimated short term and they won‚Äôt be expanding anytime soon. At least with NIO we can be certain that it‚Äôs only a matter of time when electric cars become 100% adopted.
"Hi holding, I'm Dadüë®"
Nope.
"Tomorrow is gonna get ugly every panicky weak hand  watching the after hours will sell tomorrow .  Expect 10% drop on most ev stocks .
Monday morning will be a good time to jump in and average out this mess .

But for some reason if Tesla holds even gain some grounds we could see this reverse ."
Everybody are pussies
It is going to be a looooooong time before we reach even 50% adoption.
?
"Monday is a bad time due to convertible notes.

Don't know when the note holders will sell, but there'll most likely be a dip next week."
Like seriously üòí
Yeah but imagine that growth along the way when combustion engines are completely obsolete for the common to use for transport.
Won‚Äôt go down
Have you seen the after hour
Looks like March madness all over again.
"I have calls for 19 , 20 , 21 im in big loss. Hoping for something tomorrow."
This is why I don‚Äôt trade lol. Go super long and the small dips don‚Äôt hurt
"No, where did you hear it from? Source?"
Texted my wife she says it‚Äôs not true
"I saw an article somewhere about the nio piloting system, not sure if it was just about the update or just a general article, will see if I can find it again"
"It was from another redditor several months ago... I‚Äôm out of the loop on Nio software, so if it‚Äôs not ringing a bell for people here, then it‚Äôs probably not the case"
Thanks Your wife works for Nio?
"Yes 

Source am wife"
There is an article saying Drive on Nio Pilot will be pushed as an OTA update before Beijing auto show.  Is that not true ?
THAT ONE DUDES WIFE WAS RIGHT!!
"So deliveries, production are steadily going up. New head of autonomous driving department is just getting settled in his new position as we speak AND the latest share offering of over 100m shares, together with the recent funding will ensure NIO has the liquidity to push forward with increasing production capacity for all three models. Furthermore, they're going to pedal-to-the-metal on their R&D and autonomous driving as well as getting ready the upcoming sedan, all of this while eyeing the European market.

It's been a risky bet for NIO, but the orchestration of this plan is quite brilliant and it's very satisfying to see all of these moving parts coming together to solidify this company's baseline.

An enticing story based on a visionary mission (albeit following through Tesla's comet tail to some extent), which is now backed up by their balance sheet.

Overall, it makes me think this is one of the first success stories we will be seeing more and more often of, coming from the Chinese market, as they make a run for the top position of our global economy."
"""In August, we achieved our best-ever monthly performance on both deliveries and order growth,‚Äù said William Bin Li, founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of NIO""

Every month a new record. Glad to be part of this company."
Woo hoo
awesome Nio definitely winning majority of 56% of whole world EV. Demand continues to rise other startup wont have battery swap until 2024 something. Nio should license it or something but not giving away to Tesla at any cost! Nios has a leading advantage. Soon Tesla cannot sell great due to the inconvenience of charging. Nio definitely going to worth $100 at this rate. If they are smart need to prepare Tesla and other comeback but Nio has been preparing this technology since 2015 way ahead like 5 years ahead. with more than 1000 swap stations leave other competitors behind the dust
Love to see it man NIO going up big time üìà
Great news! Looking forward to market open in the morning :) wish they would just hurry up and expand so I could buy one already
"Wow, production capacity of 5000 in September? That's a 25% increase from august"
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
I'm just curious why pre-market is down 1.5% though. Shouldn't people be buying?
Good to see best ever order growth as well!! Excited to see Septembers numbers with the EC6 being delivered and production capacity being increased!
"Can I jizz my pants now... Are we gonna get our first '5' next month...uuuuuweeee

‚ÄúAs we continue to improve the production capacity for all NIO products, our monthly capacity will reach 5,000 units in September to support our future deliveries."""
So my 516 share all in bet into NIO is not stupid? üò´ someone hold me
"Look at the people in comment, confused /worried about sales up but stock down. NIO is a buy and accumulate , not daytrading stock. long term prospect is excellent. Li Bin can't control US stock market but he can control how NIO as a company will perform."
"Welp, im buying more calls"
"Welcome to the ev market, where the ups and downs pull harder than an EP1"
Are all of these sales in china?
I thought NIO going up?
"Tesla sucks!!!!! Omg, forget Musk. He‚Äôs a tool. NIO is truly leading edge"
Apparently there's a massive sell off of momentum shares going in which affecting everything.
"If the market wasn't having her period today, NIO would have been a double digit percentage gain today."
Guys I'm super bullish market is bleeding today and nio is still treading water big rally coming with nio 25$ by next earnings i predict
And the stock is down.
Are these results good or bad? And is the stock expected to go up or down today?
I have a nio and I am satisfied
The good news for Nio just keeps on coming. May it continue for eons loool
Expect it to drop today on this good news
This is what I had expected  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms1Q10\_b3XI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms1Q10_b3XI)

Lol i called it yesterday
Well said.
"risk is over but dont underestimate other companies. Nio will be the first to  push leading technologies out

"" up faster than Tesla soon. China's market is bigger. Imagine the Government give incentives or convince people to switch from gas to electric vehicles due to factory pollution. They must do this step because i been to Beijing its air is a lots worst its doesnt have clear and blue sky like us in USA. at one time 500 factories were shut down to clear the air pollution. Now Nio is like Ford startup. including 270 million **cars** as of 2020 you know the real deal. even small pie put nio in a good position and profit coming alone soon. Only one car company can do this right now is Nio. I'm sure they will push even harder and faster before everyone jump the EV wagon. China people support their domestic car its 100% their people will invest in Nio and buy their car as well. If they come to the USA i will buy their car as well so never-ending story! "" we have to pass our words to others to join this Nio reddit."
"Look into Li‚Äôs bio. He did this with another car review company prior to Founding NIO, dude is a genius"
Stonks drop on good news these days.
"My guess is that the market is dragging it down, namely TSLA? Disappointing either way."
">Reply

I dont think everyday market up or down about Nio i just leave it in my account and lock it for a year"
üíé
They are only in China currently
"Whole market is down though, I think it's maybe to do with the announcement that US national debt is set to exceed the size of the economy next year."
With all good news stocks goes down xd
Market is red
Twitter not available in fkn China.
"I believe competition will drive up innovation considerably, especially in such a strong EV market as China. That being said, Nio is pretty well positioned at this moment due to a handful of different factors, such as strong branding, good quality of their cars (luxury EV SUVs), their entire lifestyle ecosystem, their balance sheet and ofc BaaS service, among others.

My guess is they won't have an easy roadmap to establishing themselves as the lead EV car manufacturer in China, but they have definitely set themselves up nicely for this challenge. Looking back, a lot of positive things happened in a pretty short amount of time, even with the covid19 backdrop looming over everyone's head. That's saying something.

As usual, anything can happen... However, by the current looks of it - Nio is definitely a strong bet for the future (considerably more so, even compared with a few months ago)."
"In order to do that nio has to start producing budget/basic model evs, not just luxury cars"
"A lot of the news has been priced in, and people who got in early take profits after big moves."
"This literally happens every time there is good news. Quick surge followrd by bigger drop. Its normal, can't explain why tho"
"Could I trouble you to elaborate? I mean I get that there are sellers hence the price is done, but why? I'm wondering if it's due to the short-sellers doing their thing again and they are expecting prices to be pushed down as the short-volume piles up.  


On that note, is short-selling allowed during pre-market?"
"Oh okay, thought they sold to other asian countries also!"
"Well, i see the start-up CEO hang out together to discuss at the club  and anyway it will be hard to fail for them. If the three teams up will dominate the majority of EV market. They understand their customers and threat etc"
"I agree with most of your analysis on this. Really well thought out. My only addition is the challenge I see with scale. Not so much operationally, but in penetrating the large Chinese consumer market.

Aside from great engineering, Tesla‚Äôs secret sauce continues to be their zero dollars spent on advertising. For most companies that is one of their largest expense categories. NIO is no different.

NIO has a strong brand and have done well cultivating a customer base that‚Äôs invested in their cars; that said, it‚Äôs been expensive. I‚Äôm interested to see how they get from 4,000 deliveries to 10,000 deliveries per month and how they manage the marketing costs associated."
That‚Äôs what BAAS allows then to do... at least more affordable.
"You can just have a look at the smartphone industry in the past 10 years, where we had Apple as a spearhead innovator gaining huge market share in the first years of the smartphone boom.

There are a few Chinese companies whose market penetration strategy has been to either come up with extremely affordable devices (OnePlus) OR shoot for those high-spec, not-so-affordable devices (Huawei). Once established, they of course made changes to their marketing mix, in terms of product positioning, pricing, etc.

We are already seeing highly affordable EVs on the Chinese market, however they do not cater to the medium-high earning class in China: the people who can afford to commute AND travel using an EV (thus playing into China's electrical transformation narrative). It's clear that there is ample space for Nio to unravel their strategy of pushing luxury cars first, followed up by family-oriented vehicles in the upcoming years.

Just have in mind that this is a company with a good balance sheet, who knows how to take advantage of their position and who is thoughtful with its next steps. This is something that will come to true fruition in the next 5-7 years, the hype you are seeing now is what Tesla benefitted from a few years back.

It's a similar path, but I suspect we will see some frog leaps being taken, grace √† Tesla paving the way for the rest of the world to follow through."
"I mean usually yes, but there have been more favourable exit points before so that doesn‚Äôt really hold up now. It‚Äôs just a really odd market with people pre-empting drops and thereby causing those same drops."
"‚ÄùBuy the hype, sell the news‚Äù kind of deal."
"Honestly I‚Äôm not knowledgeable on short selling but I think pre-market doesn‚Äôt make a difference there. Usually NIO (and all EV stocks) have followed TSLA, as they are basically the whole EV market as far as the stock market is concerned. 

So TSLA being down 6% is bound to have some effect on NIO‚Äôs momentum and price. Also NASDAQ is down as of now, which usually hurts speculative, high growth stocks like this."
Like which ones?
"That's a very good point. We all know that Tesla has been and still is, to a large extent, the spearhead of this large transformation within the transport industry. This alone has contributed vastly to their global reach, besides Elon having an innate understanding of memetics as well as his excellent ability to inspire and mobilize people around his ideas (thinking about it now, this might have been the catalyst behind most of his decisions over the past decade in regards to Tesla). 

Having said this, Tesla's status did not come cheap, as the hefty price has been translated into years and years of non-profitability. It was a high-risk, high-payoff situation, and we've all seen the results of this bet this year.

Nio does not have the same opportunity Tesla had, so the financing for 'being on people's minds' has to come from somewhere else. Which is why I suspect they came up with the entire lifestyle ecosystem which is meant to capture people's imagination and stir discussions in the same way as Tesla's 'imagine this electric future' topic did. 

While a different lifestyle where Nio is taking care of part of your daily concerns is not as exciting as revolutionizing the world transportation, it's still a decent hook, for which Nio must pay one way or another. As we've seen, they chose a path with earlier profitability (or at least aiming for it), while having to fund for it.

I think the positioning of their upcoming sedan model will translate their strategy of reaching the 10,000 deliveries and will offer more insight into their moves and marketing strategy. The EC6 model is definitely a good base, as an affordable, solid Model Y competitor and my guess is that it will extend their mind reach over the next 6-12 months."
"Upfront, but after 6 years, it costs more than buying a battery from the start. From the customer perspective its cheaper upfront, but as an investor of the company, operational cost will be higher, dealing with battery storage and logistics."
"Agree. But I do think this number was expected, and a lot of people were probably holding for a possible upside surprise. When that doesn‚Äôt happen they bail early. Lots of swing traders in this stock lately"
I would call it weaks hands üòâ
maybe someone is betting Nio pose decline sale. All we need to do everyone is buy at premarket to crush the short seller so they wont do it again
"I mean yes and no... these are monthly figures and are being touted as a big thing - by NIO stockholders only. Quarterly numbers are a big thing, few people actually give a flying fuck about what happened in a 20 business day window. Lastly, the threat of Russia sanctions is lurking, and that will hit the entire market hard, be prepared."
See you all on mars
Can an expert in the markets why premarket is down when good news like this is up though?
To the moon
 up faster than Tesla soon. China's market is bigger. Imagine the Government give incentives or convince people to switch from gas to electric vehicles due to factory pollution.

What about deliveries for ec6? All I see is es6 and es8
further than that buddy. 100 b is coming to Nio and still undervalued
"The pre-market means nothing, too little volume to be a good indicator."
"Wait till like 830-9.

Thats when the premarket starts to move"
"So one of the biggest shareholders of Tesla sold a big stake, the overall market for electric vehicles right now is down slightly. Don't worry about this though, I'm anticipating a climb to new all time highs by Monday.

you see those in the September report. I think delivery's start on the 25th.
September 3 at 4:00 AM ETD
Nio isn't obliged to provide monthly sell numbers. It is their decision on this. Take what you want from this.
Should be any minute now...
"They ALWAYS post press releases at 4am Eastern time. Usually report sales of vehicles in the first few days of the month. Last month it was on the first business day. It has also been on the 5th. I‚Äôm guessing by the end of this week. Whoever was shorting/selling today was in total control. Millions of shares were put up just before the ask should have changed, holding the price. Millions."

Good news today so that means its going to plummet
Curious to know how @nio sits in everyone‚Äôs portfolio? I.e % wise? Sits about 23% for me
"Whole market is down ya'll. Average cost down should be your approach here if you're long term. I'm looong term here so I'm holding. 

We just got another increased monthly deliveries AND sales orders. Company is in a good position, the market itself is not."
"""Bad news"" (dilution) vs good news (delivery number), it's going to be an interesting day."
What the actual fuck
Building solid ground now!üòÅ
60%
Should be a boring period for Nio now that the production and dilution numbers are out.
How low can we go
50%

Only holding 9.5, I added 4.5 today when I seen it go below my average price, trying to decide if I should put the rest of what I have set a side in it or spread it out between everything else I‚Äôm holding."
But good news that they have already completed the sale so won't affect the stock any further. Am I understanding that right?
Sums up the days trading perfectly
Thats when you buy
$0.00
Yes.
same here
thankyou thats all i need. no further questions
Going down alot rn hopefully turns around when market opens.
So they went from 75 million to 88.5 million to 101 million shares. Not sure how to interpret this. Good thing or bad? Lots of demand for the stock at $17 bucks a pop. No doubt about that.
"ok, pretty sketchy. 

let‚Äôs hope the name ‚Äúmorgan stanley‚Äù stands for something reputable"
">101,775,000 American depositary shares (the ‚ÄúADSs‚Äù), each representing one Class A ordinary share of the Company, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to an additional 13,275,000 ADSs (the ‚ÄúADS Offering‚Äù), at a price of US$17.00 per ADS.

8.28% to 9.43% dilution to raise 1.73 to 1.955B$ doesnt seem too bad.

>The Company plans to use the net proceeds from the ADS Offering mainly to increase the share capital of and the Company‚Äôs ownership in NIO China, to repurchase equity interests held by certain minority shareholders of NIO China, and for research and development in autonomous driving technologies, global market development and general corporate purposes.

Especially if use for independence, R&D, expansion and growth.

It looks like it has already been priced in now so August delivery numbers and to the moon is what's left."
"Lol

To you people justifying this nonsense, you‚Äôve been played and don‚Äôt even know it.

Morgan stanley issues the $20 price target.

Morgan stanley is also the underwriter on the issuance. 

Lol"
"they issued the 88m plus the optional 11m already now (instead of only in the following 30 days). which means investors are eager to have gotten as many shares as they possibly could from NIO. Forget dilution, the positive side of this news is much larger"
is the same offer
They went from 70 to 88 barely taking a hit. Going to 101 won‚Äôt do much eiither
I hope William Li keeps the shareholders interest in mind while he makes these decisions. $1B in offering is a lot of money
I'm with you dude. This might have been strategic. Offer the shares just before the August delivery number. Sit back and watch the stock explode.
Oh shit
"I mean the entire stock market is getting butchered, friend."
Lol. Dont tell i did not warn you. When market goes down more likely than not every stock goes down. Nasdaq was at ATH and it needed a breather
"Yeah the whole market is doing bad right now.. however, NIO is doing not-so-bad as the likes of Tesla, Nikola, Li Auto, Xpeng, etc. Really hoping it recovers next week based on good delivery numbers."
"Do you fucking retards ever look at other positions?

The market is dumping!"
There's a massive sell of of momentum shares going on which is apparently hitting everything.
Lol this day is a joke. Every time nio reports great deliveries earnings etc the market panics and the stock drops in price followed by 1 week later a crazy rally nobody predicts
Comment in daily post...
"Short term the market is a voting machine, long term it‚Äôs a weighing machine. This will be factored in over time!"
I‚Äôd like to buy NIO stock. Where do I go? Any advice for a complete beginner.
fuck just lost alot of money.....
Nio pulled out a bunch of money. Tesla investors pulled out a bunch of money the only people putting in money it seems are the banks. Maybe they‚Äôre preparing for an impending crash
Why is that pandafy?
"Lol, oh yeah, you're the dude that got -10 for basically saying there's a non-zero chance a retraction happens. 

This isn't even too bad. The stock market might legitimately crash again sometime relatively soon."
Yeah i think the same because most of my portfolio is Nio and Tesla. So i hope in the upcoming weeks a strong bullish trend.
Somebody has a problem
To true
Yes. I'm starting to hate NIO glowing good news. Fuck my Nov20 Call! FK!
Now is a good time to buy.Buy as much as you can now
How much
Most? Why not all?
Everything is in the red just learn to not have tunnel vision

Yep I'm getting my space suit on
When will they announce the sales for September?
Where‚Äôd Li say this
"Li numbers aren't that good compared to July. OK it's equivalent to their Q1 in 1 month but a bit drop MoM. 

One company performance doesn't reflect another one so you can't consider them."
Why is Li priced the same as NIO when NIO has far more sales?
4084
Source?
"Out of curiosity, how‚Äôs does anyone feel on li? I was holding a few shares and dipped out when it started going down the other day, I‚Äôve heard next to no game plan or what their supposed vision is. I just personally started think their price might be too high still right now, so I put those back in nio."
In fact it could mean opposite. E.G. ‚ÄúMcDonald‚Äôs reports record sales; Burger King loses money‚Äù. The amateur hour on this page ruins the 2-3 valuable posts a month
"Cheers mate, let‚Äôs hope Nio pulls"

"can‚Äôt disagree. one thing to say is, China is about 47% of the global EV market. steady sales is great during times like this. EV is a growing market and Nio is well positioned at the moment to capture this in the future.

btw I‚Äôm a long Nio. I also pointed out that I‚Äôm more interested in september numbers because they announced a lot of news august. They also just received lots of money so I‚Äôm excited to see what they do the next couple of months with it."
"i‚Äôve got the basket of all three. 

hoping for the best!"
Li is way more expensive than nio. So is xpeng. Yet that guy downvoted me for telling him to sell them for nio.
"Don't just look at price. You need to check the number of outstanding shares too. These 2 combine into the market cap of a company.

* LI - 920.93M shares \*  $17.87 => Market cap: 16.46B
* NIO - 1.22B shares \* $19.90 => Market cap:  24.33B 

Comparing market cap, NIO is around 150% of Li Auto."
source?
LI Numbers were solid but not amazing...
Baskets suck. One will outperform all the others. Just buy nio.
"eh, theoretically as the market develops all should rise. 

kinda like Uber and Lyft, but both. When things are a bit more developed, choose your pony!

NIO is my biggest though"
Idc if all rise. I want the one that rises the most. You are leaving money on the table by diversifying.
"You‚Äôre also risking it all for something that may not pan out, effectively giving money to the table instead of just leaving some."
Time in the market beats timing the market
What about that guy on here who always complains about daily discussion and said sell the rip and buy back at 16.30-16.50?  Never reached it and now he has to fomo back in and lose gains. Best strategy is just hold forever and keep buying more especially on dips.
Much better than buying in at $25 or $30 ;)
"12 months from now you will either be on the moon...or staring at it. 
NIO will far FAR exceed anyones expectations. PERIOD."
Time to buy lol what a selloff
Just make sure you watch it and stay for the long term. It is not a stock to trade
"Threw in 200 shares at 19,70 something"
Choo choo!
What‚Äôs the chance of these vehicles making it to the U.S?
"Be cautious. NIO is at ATH along with Nasdaq

Edit: Wow. These cult like fanboys don‚Äôt have a clue. You don‚Äôt buy stock at whatever price and at Nasdaq ATH. Wait for the pullback and then enter. 

Market have been irrational for last few weeks and that is not normal. We haven‚Äôt had any kind of pullback that made a bull like me worried as well. Sure you can‚Äôt time the market but strategy should be buy the dips not in overbought condition. Today stock made double top at $21 and then sold off because NASDAQ went down"
Unless you aren't smart enough to recognize this is NIOs TIME!!
"It is a stock to daytrade it look at the volume.
Also supergood for long term."
"Eventually?  100%.  There are some driving around the west coast, but they're extremely rare to see.  HQ is in San Jose for the US, I believe.  Not expecting widespread USA sales for a few years, but with them moving into the Euro market next year I would anticipate a lot of growth & interest. 
Although miles behind, they're still the closest rival to Tesla at the moment IMO."
"Doesn't matter to me, I'm in for the long haul.  Timing the market is useless anyway."

"This sub is turning in a blinded fan boys zone. 

The guy said nothing wrong, just a little warning and you're downvoting him like he shat on an EC6. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Easy to say tough to do. The guy on here that complains about the daily discussion everyday said to sell and buy back at 16.30-16.50. It never reached that value and now he probably fomoed back in but hides that fact. He lost out on gains by trying to buy back too low. Best way to ride the bull is buying regularly regardless of price and then buy even more when it dips. Never sell a bull stock.
"Yea, I agree, the stock will have to retract at some point."
Shit thanks. Did not know they already had some here. BUY BUY BUY!!
"Choo choo mutha F@#ka , ride that train to the moon"
That's what they said about Tesla. Don't listen to this guy
"I mean Tesla went down to like $350 this year and that was pre-split. In the long run, it didn't matter, but it definitely retracted.

The stock will definitely go down a lot on it's way to go up more. That's just how it works."
When did I say about TSLA? Back your comment up with claim
Listen to this guy. Buy high sell low
Didnt it just do that a few days ago? The stock market is moving at an crazy phaseüòÖ
Don't need to. Just look at why your comment is being down voted
"You mean Tesla?

Tesla was at one point around $350 after the crash this year. It climbed from $350 to around $2500 and the stock split happened, which split it to $500"
"Every company crashed hard in March, Nio too.."
Yeah and that's the main point. No company is safe from retractions.
"Shorting is a natural part of trading.  If you believe in a company you should love the shorts.

They allow you to buy at cheaper prices and when a squeeze happens, you see the long term advantage of dollar cost averaging."
"It‚Äôs all good. That can‚Äôt keep it down forever and as long as NIO keeps on this course we‚Äôre good.  Appreciate the data.

Edit: I know there was some expectation that those convertible notes would come online after August delivery numbers drive it up, much like after earnings.  Only, the share reissue took care of that problem so I‚Äôm not sure."
"The shorts should be accumulating in preparation for the convertible notes that becomes optionable coming Saturday. Meaning, they expect the price to decline next ~~Monday~~ Tuesday (Monday is Labor-day)

If we get Aug Delivery report this week, I'll most likely be selling cover-calls for next week."
Haha soon or later they shorts will run out of money!
Never bet against Li Bin.
NIO > Tesla
Delivery #s I think are over 4k this August
When do they usually release the delivery numbers?
I feel like someone or some entity was manipulating NIO like crazy today. Consistent 4mil shares being bought and sold. On a side note my $20 calls are looking real nice rn after dipping up and down all day.
Are they going to report numbers tomorrow?
Buy shares and sell puts. Easy money.
There is more than just some positive news regarding this company!
"Agree, nice that you mention it"
Evidence?
most likely anytime this week.
You could look at previous months...they report every month....
"Shhhh youre just supposed to agree and ""to the moon when?"""
yea they usually release them the first few days of the month
"I'm pretty sure when they were having financial troubles and when the sales weren't good they were not releasing them, maybe that could tell us if the delivery number were good or not."
"Hahaha right. My bad.

NIO $75 by 10/1"
Thats very optimistic ngl
"Gotta be in it to win it and my as well be positive while I'm at it.

I'm joking on the previous comment btw if you didn't read the thread"
"Hi at it, I'm Dadüë®"
Decided not to care about volatility and now I have 18k in NIO. See you guys in 2 years!
I guess that since nothing was released by now we might get the Numbers tommorow
Just bought a dec 16 2022 call option at 27 üòÇ
New high today? $22 lets go
"Grabbed another 7 as it dipped below 20, should of waited for the bottom of the dip! Ah well, happy with them still at this price. Hanging out for numbers!"
"For my sake I hope the August sales aren‚Äôt released til thursday or Friday, because I‚Äôm trying to buy in ASAP tomorrow to catch the wave üöÄ"
Did anyone else feel like the Tesla investors are starting to get into Nio? Yesterday tesla stock  felt like an inverse of Nio but probably seeing stuff that isn‚Äôt there
[deleted]
"Well ended up with a nice severance package after 18 years of service and couldn't wait till funds were available in brokerage account...once available I got in on 8/24 @ 14.48 1K shares. I also picked up Tesla pre-split and had nice run from 397.00 adjusted purchase price then dumped today at just over 460.00 after the pull back. Honestly, I just got in to ride momentum, but the Telsa holding scared the the hell out of me unlike my other positions where I bought more of to hold long. Anyhow, this is my 1st reddit post ever and have been following the comments regarding NIO the past few weeks. I truly hope this is the one holding that takes off üöÄ  astronomically and we can all look back at this time that is life changing for all of us. This is the one stock I chose to allocate and consider high risk - with life changing potential. The rest of my severance went to Apple, Netflix and Amazon to add to my other holdings mixed funds etc I already had. I think I will continue to get solid returns as I have throughout the years, but Nio is the one holding that I'm the most excited about at this time. The early gains since 8/24 gave me that desired buffer to hold on tight and enjoy the ride. Goodluck to all!"
Nio reported numbers
Where can we find the numbers after they are released? Hopefully you lads can get some   in on time before the launch!
Better to invest now before numbers are announced or wait for announcement?
What‚Äôs target for tomorrow? After numbers released?
3965 for August delivery. NEW RECORD BABY
What time does the stock open gmt
I‚Äôm taking a simple approach to nio. The company is making all the right moves and produces a good product. Would I want to buy one? Yes. Also less than 50 bucks. How is this not a buy??
"For the sake of my $20c 9/4, I really hope."
Rip
Based on release date in former months I assume they will realese the numbers today at 4am EDT. I would not mind if they are below expectations since I‚Äòd like to add some further shares myself...
"Ehh, it's probably nothing. I feel as though EV traders ride waves between the EV stocks all the time."
I actually didn‚Äôt know this. I‚Äôm gonna wait out the delivery numbers this week and then hop off the bus probably and see how the extra shares plays out
How much will this effect the current stock price?
It‚Äôd be cool if those shares were released before the numbers.
"Hi the most excited about at this time, I'm Dadüë®"
Where?
https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases?mobile=1&page=0 here u go
Now
"definitely now. under 20, by end week, 25+ if numbers are announced"
In an hour mate
"It definitely a great buy. Cheap, with potential.

I feel like there's a lot of unnecessary distrust towards the company just because it's Chinese. If this was an American company, I am pretty sure the price would be in the one hundreds now. 

Other than making all the right moves, NIO cars look and work awesome and their CEO have great ambition as well as passion. NIO also calls themselves a mobility company rather than an EV company. This means that in the future, they could move onto other forms of transport. How is this not a massive plus? Imagine in the future having NIO airplanes with NOMI. The potential is endless and I just hope that NIO is able to fulfil their potential.

One thing I fear, however, is that Tesla would be able to come up with a million mile battery. NIO CEO mentioned that the company came up with the idea of battery swapping due to the poor advancement in battery technology as compared to technology in general. You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nJ7-s8IZPc). So if Tesla is able to deliver on that promise, NIO's BaaS will be rendered redundant. And if the general consensus is that a million mile battery is compulsory, Tesla can drive up the cost of the battery and this lead to both lower profit margins for their competitors and more expensive EVs other than Tesla's own. Both scenarios which are bearish for NIO."
Diamond hand
"I expect them to crush the numbers, record orders, if nothing happened to them maybe 4.5k deliveries"
Ditto - Great minds think alike.
This is thought to have first happened a few weeks ago when $200 million in convertible bonds became available for conversion. IIRC there was an 8% decline that day. This upcoming potential conversion is valued at $235 million. Not sure what the affect will be this time. Only time will tell.
"In at 18.81, best of luck everyone!"
"if Tesla really delivers on the million mile battery, BaaS become silly. i fully agree and i‚Äôm that is one of my main concerns.

however, if Telsa delivers on the million mile battery, they will prove a concept. i bet a competitor will make a 200k mile battery very quickly and the battery moat is gone."
I fear you are correct...
"That is true and actually something I have not thought about. Thanks for that. I was thinking that Tesla would keep the production a secret but then again after your comment it came to my mind that other companies can always buy the battery and figure out the workings of the battery.

Nonetheless, I fully have trust in NIO that they will be able to come up with another unique selling point should BaaS become pointless.   Cheers."
What do you think the cost of a million mile battery would be? I think probably very expensive
"Even if baas becomes pointless, a company making high quality, brand driven cars with record breaking increase in production is worth more than 20! They will adapt I‚Äôm sure"
"i know. 

and my point is a million mile battery is probably overkill. and won‚Äôt be nearly the competitive advantage people think it is. 

but it will render BaaS useless."
Such a brave investor you are. A true believer in NIO!!
"let me know when you sell, I will buy it"
Congratulations you can buy 6 cheese burgers from Mcdonalds with that money if you cash out now! Quick before it dips!
"Just sell it, and dont look at the stock charts if you dont think about buying it üòÖ dont let the precentage of something you dont own haunt youüòÇ"
"Avg price lol  , it‚Äôs one stock."
Yup! I was such a true believer that I moved all of my shares over to my ISA account because I believed this stock will outperform my other investments. Seems to have paid off hahah. This is just one share I left in my old invest account before the avg price change. I‚Äôm still holding all my original shares today! 1k>
I stand corrected! What‚Äôs the benefit of an ISA account? Why not just hold the shares long and not sell?
"Investments made on an ISA account in my country is free from capital gains tax, so I don‚Äôt think I have to pay tax on the profits of the investment. I believed Nio could‚Äôve been my best return so I stuck it all in my ISA earlier in the year. (I‚Äôm fairly new to trading so I could be wrong, just going to carry on holding as the good news comes in!)"
Nio got removed from ISA last week üò≠
Don‚Äôt try to pick pennies in front of a steamroller.
Just keep buying regularly regardless of price. Tsla bulls also missed out on huge gains thinking exactly like you.
Its looking doubtful at this point but rememeber anything can happen
Yes and no. Nobody knows for sure. If they did they wouldn't be posting it on Reddit either.
17.00 incoming!!
Yeah I missed out buying at 480 in earlier in the year when it went to 520 I was saying I‚Äôll buy if it drops... it never dropped back down. Just buy it and hold on for the ride
Why
u can buy it now
I cannot answer this question.
"If you're in it long, don't think twice.

&#x200B;

If I had extra cash, I would put it in NIO as well."
"Buy and forget if you are holding over a year.

For short term, be prepared for a roller-coaster ride. Volatility is very high. If you can't stomach the ups and downs, it'll make you lose sleep."
"If it won‚Äôt break the bank, buy few more slowly. I have 5 as well.

Don‚Äôt buy it on margin though"
Give it a few days
Where do you guys see Nio at? Any price targets?
"I'm in since $7.2. Sold a third of positions at $19.2. Valuation is fairly high, 15x revenues. Obviously there is high growth, China's advantage, but the company probably needs to grow into its valuation before the share price can rise again. 
So I wouldn't double down just yet."
WILL NIO GO ABOVE 17?
"Buy as much as you can with whatever means that you have. Margin, heloc, max out credit cards. Just keep buying."
"Yup, I‚Äôm all in. $20k from $8k"
500 right?
"Back in early July, I was expecting $20 by end of year, and would have been happy with that. Now that the stock is very stable at $19-20, it's anyone's guess really. But, if I was to guess, $25 minimum by year's end (because we'll have ec6 sales and earnings reports which are projected to be very good), and probably $40 this time next year."
Over 100 in 12 months.
"Got in at $6, $9 and $11. Sold all at $19.25ish and said less than one week ago I wouldn't buy back in until it hit $17 but with August Sales numbers likely to be posted in the coming days, likely tomorrow or the day after, I think I'll just chance my hand and assume it'll bump the price like it did in July and August. 

The biggest investors (second biggest shareholder of Tesla, Goldman Sachs, etc) buy into the vision of this company long term and I do too. The benefit of a stock this volatile is you can cash out and rebuy more stock for your money fairly regularly - as the peaks and troughs are so much closer (and significantly more predictable) than most other stocks atm. 

Make the decision that suits you but I'm backing NIO to the moon tomorrow üöÄ"
It‚Äôs at 20 now man
Yes üò¨
I could see it go even higher. I am thinking $23 by end of the week.
"Such a great strategy! Sell high, buy higher right? If you hadn't tried to troll so many people out of their shares last week about how NIO was about to imminently correct you'd not have lost any of your share count. The dilutive event and the market uncertainty that followed literally came to your rescue otherwise we'd already be at $25+ right now.  Since it's pretty clear the dilution is actually a net positive we should resume the path towards the high 20's for the rest of this week."
We‚Äôll see
"After withdrawing from NIO I daytraded a little and bought 3 X Apple and gained bigger than I would have done by HODL'ing NIO anyway. 

I had three or four separate opportunities to rebuy lower but didnt as I expected a harsher correction. My portfolio is up 25% since July, NIO is my biggest win but I have others that have done very well in that window too.

I didn't try and troll anybody to sell shares. I am happy to DM you and send you my close order, as well as my original open orders if you like? I made what I thought to be an informed decision based on what happened when NIO hit an ATH at $15. Admittedly the dip and slower acceleration this week wasn't what I predicted, I had anticipated a significantly more bloody and rapid decline than this. So it certainly shows NIO has legs if it can still hold $20 in times of adversity.

I'm now confident that the market had it's chance to rectify and didn't, so am now exploring my options but remain very reluctant buying in at these prices. I'm relatively new to this, as you can probably tell, and am purely giving advice to people that seem to have less idea than I do. No ill intent. Just speculating."
I agree on all fronts. Its not like they are just gonna take that money and burn it $NKLA *cough. If anything this is good for investors means they're actively making progress toward their future goals.
"We would not be at $25. The company valuation at a $25 share price would be egregious, until at least next earnings."
"Tf do you mean we‚Äôll see, it‚Äôs already at $20 lmao"
"Hi now confident that the market had it's chance to rectify and didn't, so am now exploring my options but remain very reluctant buying in at these prices, I'm Dadüë®"
Right now it is.
"$20.55, hopefully we will see $21 today"
"Just buy and hold. Check back in 6 months. 

Mods, delete these threads and make a sticky thread called "" should I buy"""
You are destined to lose all your money if you don't educate yourself. [Watch this guy's videos for a month before putting a penny anywhere.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMn36GT_H0X-w5_ckLtlgQ)
"There's no real way to answer that.  I find with the market in general there are always more reasons not to be invested than to be.... global politics, the price is too high, growing competition, pandemic, etc.  Long term, I think NIO is the most credible pure EV challenger to Tesla, and it's the home team in a huge and growing marketplace with a government policy of 25% electric in just a few years.  Short term it can absolutely go down, but it also might not.  I think in a year or so it's fairly likely to have crossed $40.  As with anything there are no guarantees, so decide how rough a ride you want to be in for and know it can be really volatile.  Set your risk accordingly"
"I‚Äôd personally try to catch it around 18, it seems to have stayed between 18-20 lately. It quickly went up from when I got in at 13-14. But I‚Äôm also for the long term so a couple extra cents isn‚Äôt going to make me fret about it. My average now is 18.22, I really keep hoping for a drop and will pick a few more up if that ever happens, regardless I‚Äôm adding more though. 

They‚Äôve got strong fundamentals, they‚Äôre turning a profit, they‚Äôre backed by the government and there are plenty of incentives for going their route, plus they‚Äôre pretty bullish on themselves which makes me all the more confident. 

So far the only car company that hasn‚Äôt made me skittish."
Wait for 17.00
Very helpful! I bought in a decent amount today and will see where it goes
"How are they turning a profit???

Yahoo reports nio most recent quarter loss of 175 usd million"
"I shouldn‚Äôt have used the term turning a profit, I was just meaning they‚Äôre clearly reducing the rate of their loss and becoming more efficient. It doesn‚Äôt look like they‚Äôre bleeding nearly the same."
"You paid $0.67 per share (so $67 for the contract) for this call option. If NIO is < $21 at end of day Friday, your option expires worthless. If it is >$21 you will either be able to buy NIO for a price of $21 per share or sell or have that contract sold for approx the difference between the share price and $21 (as Friday nears the contract price vs. the share price relative to $21 will narrow). $21.67 is listed as the break even price because you would lose money overall (just not all of it, perhaps) if the share price at end of day on 9/4 is less than that, and you would make net $ if over. If the price on 9/4 is $22.67 you would make approx $100 profit, and so on."
"Yes

Lets say you paid $500 for your position. You won't make the $500 back until the price hits 21.67. After that, all other gains are profit"

"I also learned calls by just diving in..

Luckily didnt lose much.

I get it now."
Why do people buy things they dont understand? You should understand the basics before buying something. Go take a class.
"Thank god you only bought 1 contract.

Why would you buy anything without at least reading up on how it worked?"
"Just going reiterate because OP is a complete options noob: If NIO is under $21 on 9/4 you get *nothing*. Options are bets. You are betting that Nio will be at least $21 on 9/4. If it is not, you lose."
yo pm?
Omg! Thanks! üôåüèæ
Learning by doing can cost the same as some classes and the lessons often hit harder.
lmao I have no idea was just trying it out. I have one contract at 19 aswell.
so if it is 21.2 do I get anything..by that I mean do I atleast profit / net or is that only after breakeven . Only asking because when nio was 20.94 like 20 minutes ago my call said that total return was +$20 ..
Yeah send me a message
"Lol nice.

No harm in that.

Best way to learn is to buy in because itll force you to learn"
">when nio was 20.94 like 20 minutes ago my call said that total return was +$20

Because there are people out there wiling to pay a little more than you paid for your contract because they believe it'll be profitable by 9/4. The closer you get to 9/4, the less likely someone will be willing to pay a premium for a losing contract."
yeah quick question . Am I losing money on the contract I bought for $19c 9/4
"Depends on what you paid for it, your $19c 9/4 is in the money (ITM) but you won't be in the green if you paid over $0.46 for them (NIO $19.46 at time of comment). Also keep in mind trading fees."
"Depends on what you paid for it and if you plan on exercising them or not.

I would sell on thursday if you dont plan on exercising."
yeah gonna sell by Thursday.
Didn't they already say it will be like 3500-4000 because of the shutdown? That's what I keep reading here and there.
"My guess is 4,206.9 units."
"August has 5 weekends, just saying."
Chinese companies/factories are in operation 6-7 days a week. With so much missed work time from COVID earlier in the year I doubt there are any weekends off.
3800-4000 seems like the predicted and realistic expectation. Anything over and I‚Äôm be shocked. Under would be a disappointment
5.1k is my guesstimation
"They tend to under sell their target, so anything above the target 4000 is 'expected'."
When are they going to release numbers ? Tomorrow?
"***""NIO delivered 3,965 vehicles in August 2020, a new monthly record representing an 104.1% year-over-year increase""***

"I wouldn‚Äôt get overly excited about the August numbers, they probably won‚Äôt add or detract from the momentum in the stock. Just fkin hold and don‚Äôt be retards."
"I say 4200. However, I don‚Äôt know anything about the stock. I‚Äôm just here to ride the wave. Financials who???"
Are they going to report the numbers tomorrow?
"It was stated in the ER the expected delivery numbers for Q3 to be 11000-11500 units. It also stated they expect the delivery numbers in September to increase to 4500-5000 units.

July numbers = 3533 units.

11500-3533-5000 = 2967 units

11500-3533-4500 = 3467 units"
sooooo where's the damn announcement? These panic sell offs are ravaging my calls.
What day is the announcement going to be?
They usually post it on the 4th of each month.
"I highly agree with this. We have to assume at least 1 car comes off the line shy of perfect.

"Thanks, great info!!"
....aaaaaand now I'm throwing more money at this damn car. Ive got more money invested in Nio than my own piece of shit car is worth. This investment shit better work!
Shit man so much for difersifying I'm pretty much all in at this point.
I'm a little sad my investor friend said that NIO at $13 wasn't a good buy due to all the risks associated with the stock (China vs. USA) . Now I find myself buying at $19.5
"Does anyone know when August numbers are expected? I suppose by EOW for sure, but do we have a precise date?"
Early morning sell off but I think it‚Äôs going to have a good day and get back over 20.
"Loading up, testing my luck üòé (that allways means it will go down a little more because my luck sucksüòÖ)"

What do you guys think August delivery numbers will do for NIO stock price?
"Can someone explain me how they are going to put more shares on the market, the 88 million, and when? I've tried to look online but couldn't find any information about when this is happening."
Just believe as we do! üöÄ
"Same lmao. When I started investing in Nio I had a 100 shares which took about 20% of my port, but I got carried away with the profit and hype that I have bought 250 now and it takes up over 65%"
Stop believing in all this China vs. USA crap. If by chance all chinese companies got delisted from the us stock exchange without any valid reason (audit aside) China would not hesitate to retaliate in any way shape or form and that would destroy the us economy. Luckin coffee was an unfortunate circumstance because of fabricated sales but its impossible to lie about car sales.

"I do. But belief doesn't pay my bills. I'm going long, I'm happy to wait, even doubling my money in a year would be nice, and apparently statistically significant, but I get that nervous rush at market open, and it's hilarious to observe myself, pacing the lounge room, waking up for a midnight piss to check the market. I'm hooked. I'll eventually calm down and put it to the back if my mind."
Same here......just when I was diversifying my port.....Nio at 15sh...beautiful  setup. And now all in and it doesn't feel even bad. Full confident of what will come in the next few months
"Gotcha, thanks!"
This didn‚Äôt age well.
"That he bought a ""call(s)"" at strike price 18 expiring at 9/14.

Basicly it means that if NIO stock price will rise above this striking price this guy will make lots of money (the higher above the better)
If it falls below he will lose lots of money, and for every day passes while he doesnt sell he also lose some money.
This whole gain/loss situation also depends on the price of the stock at the moment he bought that option.

For nore info look ""option trading"" in google..."

"Im not that much of an expert, but as far as i know that is correct (when the contract is for 100 stocks, which is typicaly the case, you can multiply the theta by 100 for a good indication on the loss per day. Dont forget that as the day progresses, the theta changes as well).

This ""Theta"" is one of ""the greeks"" that were defined in order to help value an option technically."
Thank you for your intellect üôèüèª
Keep buying.
"Diamond hands , congratz"
Keep buying. This stock is on fire.üî•üî•üî•üî•
I bought in my first 20 shares at around $3.80. I steadily increased over time and have about over 200. Average is still sub $15 so I can‚Äôt complain but I do have regrets about not buying a thousand shares early on.
My first was 6.66. Went to 16 dollars... then to 11 and i sold mehh
I bought at 11.80 with a cost basis of 13.50.
How many do you have?
Bought at 14.07 and sold at 16.67.. definitely gonna get back in soon. Congrats üöÄüöÄ
 NIO has a brilliant management team that constantly think about ways of improving and bettering the company from a professional vantage point. With this discipline comes vision and long term goal. Making this company a force to be reckoned with. Had this been an American company the share would easily have been in the 50's based on valuation. Soon the company will be recognized for it great products and designs. Stay long. Stay strong. Tremendous gain are there to come.
"I think with good numbers for Aug we can see some ups and down for the next few months. Earnings in Nov should lift us up. We probably trade in a 19.75 -22/23 range leading up to earnings. I know everyone thinks this is going to the moon and your correct but it takes time, with that said I‚Äôm more then happy with the small 4-6% gains which seem to happen daily and every other day. Big institutional investors are holding this down under $20 and just like the 13-15 push they can‚Äôt hold it down forever. I also believe that the three institutions will exercise their right to purchase the remainder 13+million shares with in 30 days. Just sit back and don‚Äôt get caught up in daily movements, stay focused on the long term."
Seriously!
"If the stock would have gone down, you would have said you're smart..

Trust me."
$2k and then $500 after stock split
$150+
"If everything goes correct, I would estimate around $50-60. 

&#x200B;

NIO is a great company but lately expectations by shareholders on this subreddit are being driven out of hand, and that is partly due to the greatness of Tesla over the past little bit (which by the way, is also an excellent company to be long in).

&#x200B;

NIO currently has a market-cap of 22B and is roughly $19/share. At $60 a share, NIO would have a market-cap of over 66B, which would place it in the upper echelon of car manufacturers. I believe that is an attainable number in 2 years time.

&#x200B;

I would love to be wrong and I would love for my NIO shares to be $150+ in 24 months, but I don't see it happening in 2 years.

&#x200B;

Bullish Scenario (2 year outlook) - Europe expansion under way, robo-taxi ready to hit the market, BAAS taking off exponentially - $100-110 price per share.

&#x200B;

Modest/ most likely scenario (2 year outlook) - Europe expansion confirmed but still in the building/planning stages, robo-taxi showing promise but not ready for the markets, BAAS taking off exponentially - $60 price per share.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Again, I would love to be wrong."
Fun to speculate but this is a shitpost.
"Exponential growth to a global market. Going from debt to profitability, I am guessing at least 150+ as well"
"We getting that 50 boys "" get rich or die trying "" like my man 50cent !"
I think 60$ should be reasonable enough even with more dilutions. In 10 to 15 years we may not even see a petrol powered car for sale anymore in China.
"The robo taxi will be a different model than what tesla has planned.. they are putting lidar on the cars and will only be for real taxi service, not turn every car on the road into robo taxi. Just as an fyi."
215 billion with a price target of $185.75.
"$45, Tesla took 17 years to make a profit."
"In two years, everyone with at least 1,000 shares of Nio will be a millionaire. 

Then we can all celebrate."
"$0, shjt stock and you guys push it because you already too far in. It‚Äôs ass"
"$0, shjt stock and you guys push it because you already too far in. It‚Äôs ass"
"That's a bit to much, I'd say realistically anywhere between 50 and 100"
Nice to have someone talking sense in here
"Noob here, does expending outside of a country really take that long?"
You‚Äôre 100% wrong because it‚Äôs worth $300
Do you think TSLA might drop by election time? I just do not understand why its going up quickly again.
Someone got burned on a weekly FDüò≠ take your butt hurt ass and go buy Nikolai
Then short it and post a screenshot of it. Dont be that guy that just talks.
That's quite the detailed analysis. Did you intern at Goldman or Morgan Stanley?
EV is the future. China is huge. And they went global. Tesla $200-$2500 in a year. Nio $20 to 150-200 in 2 is just as likely as 50-100. I don‚Äôt understand where the ‚Äúrealistically‚Äù part comes in considering you‚Äôre probably basing it on your ‚Äúgut‚Äù
"Absolutely. It can take years. 

&#x200B;

Factories, warehouses, show rooms, swap stations, etc, etc, all need to be built first. Then they need to get a ton of approvals from the government, not to mention completing all of the legal work. A lot more goes into it, much more than I can describe in a small paragraph."
"Tough to say. You can certainly make a strong case for Tesla to drop a few percentages in the near future, but whether that is due to it being election season or something else, remains to be seen.

The rally today was likely due to the split. You can expect it to keep rallying up until battery day (September 22nd, 2020)."
Fomo
"Nope, actually sold all my shitty NIO stock"
"no actually, I used common sense. The stock is over valued and is manipulated by the Chinese market"
Nio isn't tesla is it?but I'd love to be wrong!
"They‚Äôre trying to go international too fast imo. 

Why try to win international markets when they can only sell 3-5k vehicles/qtr in China?

I‚Äôd rather them strengthen domestically first"
"Imagine thinking a 10x growth of tsla applies to nio. Yea both are ev makers. But what drives stock prices? Demand. And tsla has boatload of them. Seriously, and they have a showman as a CEO. Dont see how the stock will be 50-100 in 2 years if the company doesnt expand to north america by then."
Only way you sold for a loss was if you bought at the top last week ü§° I‚Äôll take my $8 cost basis and happily walk it up to $100+ a share.
Its manipulated by the Chinese market? Where is the common sense in that statement? Do you mean the Chinese Government?
"No need for attitude here, we all like the stock. I‚Äôm just saying people threw their conservative ‚Äúgut feelings‚Äù out the window on Tesla..another EV company.. and look at it now. Just saying look at the similarities instead of highlighting the subtle differences in the two. EV is the future. I said it before and I‚Äôll say it again in two years when NIO is crossing that golden $150 line."
"The fuck numbers are you lookin at guy. They sold over 10,000 in Q2. If you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about then keep it to yourself tbh"
Imagine thinking you don‚Äôt automatically sound like a douche starting a sentence with ‚Äúimagine thinking‚Äù
"Yes, remember me when you lose your investment in NIO lmfao. They literally surface fake pictures of their car used as police patrol, they will do anything to boost their stock to benefit themselves & fact; the owner sold off a bunch of shares in his own company recently. Get ready!"
I hope you're right brother
"Imagine posting a nothingburger remark, ironic. Just downvote me if you havent already and move along."
How's that NAK investment at $1.60? Looking real good. Perhaps we should all invest in speculative mineral exploration companies.
"Either way, I‚Äôll be ecstatic with $50 a share. I just have a degree in sustainable enterprise & energy management. The way this tech is talked ab in terms of potential to mitigate climate change. And having the federal government handing out subsidies and tax breaks really make you wonder why everyone else is saying ‚Äúover valued‚Äù. Things that change the world for the better are invaluable IMO"
Haha douche bag. Take your downvotes and keep it movin buddy
Oh hey i see you're a douche bag extraordiaire. Take one too and keep it movin buddy
"Nikola is not an EV company. It only sells Tees, Polo, Jackets and Hats."
"Only Nio has that cult-like effect on its users and investors, just like Apple and Tesla. So that‚Äôs why 50 percent of my portfolio is Nio"
"Tashee Keeney stated that they are watching how the NIO story is evolving. Ark Invest will soon pounce on NIO. The whole story started around 7:50 through the end. To much focus on vertical integration from TSLA vs. NIO with mobile eye and CATL (outsourcing). You know who outsource Apple... End of story.... Apple uses economies of scale as a competitive advantage and NIO is laying the ground work.  


[https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-could-reach-7k-2024-184417689.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-could-reach-7k-2024-184417689.html)"
Can u guys only include nikola when it has a working vehicle that i can actually see run.
That's more an opinion than a research...
NIO and WKHS are my two favourites right now üöÄüöÄüöÄ
"All of them are buys in a 1 year time, ok? The question is which one is gonna run the fastestüòé"
What do you think of Fisker/SPAQ?
"How is Xpeng not a buy? Also, ARK investment said there are 150 e-car makers in China. I'm BIG and heavy into NIO, but I'm trying to understand where they are now standing out from, besides BAAS."
üòÇ
"NIO's goal IS a cult. A lifestyle brand with hats and coffee cups and an Apple store sales area. They don't even make their car bodies, so yes hopefully they create a strong cult lol."
"Focusing on vertical integration is the reason why tesla took so long to mass produce vehicles. Conversely, outsourcing is the reason why it took nio such a short amount of time to do so."
Not to be that guy but they actually have quite a few trucks that have been running. If you go the sub and check their fact checks megathread videos are posted there.
I literally have a wall of sticky notes with sales figures and notes.
I've heard very little about them. Sexy cars but I wouldn't buy any stock yet.
"Personally, I think Nio is a buy because it's the de facto local start up market leader. I also have my hands on Xpeng.

I'm not a fan of Li Auto as it's a range extender EV."
"Don't have the whole list, but [this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle_industry_in_China) shows a bunch of them.

Also: [China July EV sales](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/08/28/a-star-in-born-china-ev-sales-report/) for sales ranking.

Don't let the numbers scare you, many of them are Mini EV... which caters to a very different market. 

Personally, I think you should only focus on the more prominent ones... the ""more techno inclined"" ones with economic moats.

\---- 

The 4 that's listed in US

NIO - Don't think i need to talk more.

Li - Does hybrid for extended range.

XPEV - Close follower of Tesla, focus on Autonomous driving.

KNDI - Cheap? Didn't find any other moats.

\---- 

Not to forget the leaders:

Tesla - The biggest EV player.

BYD - The biggest Chinese EV player.

\---- 

I left out the legacy car makers like Toyota, Ford...etc... They are all pretty well known."
Xpeng way more expensive. Just buy nio.
"Link would be appreciated, aint gonna scour around searching for it."
Share your notes then.
I'm trying to find a chart of the largest EV manufacturers in China. I want to see where NIO stands.
just takes a quick google search to get to their sub really https://www.reddit.com/r/NikolaCorporation/comments/gs2uz5/top_10_nikola_naysayers_baseless_arguments_try/
I can't post pics to Reddit and will never figure it out. Take my word or do hours of research yourself.
[https://twitter.com/DKurac](https://twitter.com/DKurac) has periodical update on Chinese EV sales including bus and non startups.
Few trucks? I see 1
 so all you who were saying the offering was 20.44 ......please learn how to read sec filings it may help you in the future.......and I'm the first to admit when I'm wrong and I totally missed on my big sell off prediction Friday at opening bell I thought for sure people were gonna panic sell....either people thought the offering was 20.44 and held or NIO has a bunch of longs that know what they hold.....I will be looking at reentry today around 17 then I will adverage down or up through the week until I have full position again ......then rinse and repeat all the way to the top.......
"Stop panicking, if institutions are buying those shares for billions of dollars that means they are planning getting them back and get a lot more in the long run"
Interesting
"88,000,000 will be guzzled in min by civil institutions."
And it will keep on falling... Until August delivery numbers tomorrow maybe.
Annnnnd I‚Äôm assuming you missed the boat on $17
"wow, all these plans.. 
I just bought 2k shares more at 17.07"
"What do you even mean by getting them back? And no, it says nothing about getting more in the long run."
Wdym? U saying that when the numbers arrive the stock is taking off?
"Getting them back means getting a return at least matching what they put in. Getting more means more gains, not more shares."
"I'm expecting it to drop to 16.3-16.5$ today/tomorrow and then to rise back up to 20$ or more when the August delivery numbers are given (if they are as good as I think).

The dilution doesn't change the fundamentals of the company and that they are doing well and looking mid to long term.

It's just the way the market is, any news makes the stocks move nowadays even clear FUD."
They are buying at $17... they aren‚Äôt underwater at the moment.
"For years. Tesla bears would scream about stock dilution... and then be disappointed when it turns out well for the stock price.

That usually is because it enables growth.

Short term, however, it can be a negative or a positive based on the market dynamics. With pricing at $17, it is a short term negative."
People that listen to you and sold to buy back lower will have to fomo back in. Another guy said the same thing last earnings call. He said I'll sell at $15 and buy back in at $12.50. Never reached it and now he's fomoing everyday.
"Hi expecting it to drop to 16, I'm Dadüë®"
Also expecting 16
"You understood that I'm saying down for 2 days, right?"
Nice
"Hi saying down for 2 days, right?, I'm Dadüë®"
"I am agreeing with you. Not sure about the timing of the rise, depends on how bloody investors got and if they still have the appetite."
Why not both?
Nio
NIO. Ive benn in and out of tsla and think a P/E of 1300 is not sustainable
60% TSLA / 40% nio
tesla was a good buy PRE COVID. now its just overpriced garbage. come on dude
Kind of want to go in alittle big If i were to buy TSLA itd be atleast 10 shares
Its definitely ok to ride the wave imo
Yeah sure and whatever is left in NIO
Show me your NIO tattoo !!! ü§™. Fine Lets see what the market is saying tmmrow
"If you are long holding both, you will make money. But if you are short term then the risk is higher."
I view NIO as the longer hold. TSLA seems like such a volatile cluster fuck
"True, but I believe both companies will grow a lot in couple years. Don‚Äôt forget TSLA will be in S&P in the near future"
"William Li is fking genius. Now Xpeng stock is falling. His putting out a stock offering is almost like a second IPO, which is something that Xpeng can't do. Now those with Xpeng positions are looking at a rival that just raised another billion or two, and wondering if they have picked the wrong stock.

They have."
Off topic: is that ibkr?
Precisely.
Delivery report is coming this week for NIO too. Perfect timing having offering before the report
Xpeng is trash lol NIO is certified top domestic EV company in China
TD Ameritrade
It‚Äôs trying move up so badly...
Chinese police and airport are using nio... nio will take xpeng to the cleaners...
Its getting there.
"It'll go, the second they give it the first push its going to fly"
I LOVE FUCKING NIO.
"It‚Äôs going down today but up later this week.
Edit: that was a quick recover lol"
Jesus I feel like an idiot for buying at 19.50.
Nio to the moon
"Premarket losses? Well, that didn't last long."
"NIO, you magnificent bastard, i love you!!"
Thank you Elon!!
lol RIP those weak hands who gave in in the AM
"Dilution = down

Down + Bull = up

The above it's a 2 step process in that exact order."
"I'm expecting it to drop to 16.3-16.5$ today/tomorrow and then to rise back up to 20$ or more when the August delivery numbers are given (if they are as good as I think).

The dilution doesn't change the fundamentals of the company and that they are doing well and looking mid to long term.

It's just the way the market is, any news makes the stocks move nowadays even clear FUD."
I started the whole stock thing 2 months ago and not sure what the best plan is. Still a good idea to hold?
"Prices dosent matter now, it is just in the beginning stage of an exponential growth. Also, today would probably end in green."
"Just picked up another 50 shares at $18.44. Probably not the greatest price seen today, but I'm not a day trader. The long game suggests that this is only the beginning. When its $50/share, no one is going to care about $17.50 vs $18.50. This is the long investment, not the short term cash cow, in my opinion."
"Thanks for buying the dip lads, had to adjust my order 4 times ending up buying a dollar higher @17,90 

Don‚Äôt be that greedy and buy instantly is my advise"
Unpopular opinion but I‚Äôm betting up
I fucked up buying more options at 20 and 19
Anyone else get some more stock when It hit 16?
Hey so what are you guys thinking on price movement this week with the 75M in shares?
"I seen it‚Äôs down to 17.55, I‚Äôm hoping that holds out or drops more till morning so I can get in for cheaper. I just came across it the past week or so and slowly added more but by the end of the week my average cost was 18.11."
"Fellas, I have a 9/11 17.5C ... gota get to 19.57 just to break even. What ya think? Can NIO pump back ?"
Lol
You guys think it'll go down to 16 dollars per share or something? I am trying to purchase some shares with the whole stock dilution.
"Bought in at around 14.50, took profits this morning at 17.80 expecting a drop to the 17 offering price.  Looks like I made a mistake..."
I want to buy in but it's hard not to ride with TSLA on the short term.
Hey guys! Can someone tell me if the new shares already have been sold? Or is it just a price announcement?
How does that work?
Sniped at opening and am a very happy bunny for it
I felt the same buying for 3 when it dropped to 1.2 usd. Look were are we now. Just don't worry about short term price actions
Same. Got excited at 20.5 and bought in. Learnt my lesson. Keep emotions out of stock market. We'll be fine!
Same boat here. Bought 100 at 11.68 and sold at 19.10. Rebought 250 at 19.51 after it dipping after nearly hitting 21. 30 mins after I bought the dilution news came out.
We‚Äôll be alright fam.
"You all be cool, $20 in no time."
"apparently BYD is crushing it

i think the faith in the overall market development is very real."
I almost did!
"Hi expecting it to drop to 16, I'm Dadüë®"
Yes
"Doubled up on my position when it hit low $18s, but pre-market I could have snagged some for a little less. Worked out okay because I made money in other positions which I pulled from to buy more Nio. Still, time in the market beats timing the market when you‚Äôre holding long."
Dont you worry! I grabbed a bunch of 9/4 $20 on friday end of day!
I have $19c 9/11. Last few days have been a nail biter
keep waiting.
Yup
idk I‚Äôll let you know in 6 hours and 30 mins
"Have some for 9/25, let‚Äôs hope so haha"
"I think the dip for today is just gone, 17 lowest"
"Think not to be honest, just buy asap and you won‚Äôt miss"
Why would you take profits at 17.80 and not at 21 last week?!
Lock in period is 90 days.
Fucking missed the half hour snipe when it went down to 17. Oh well
Take your upvote and get out of here
So did I but mine are like -68% lol fml
Lol this aged like milk
Got 100 more at 16.99 on open in the end. Halo with that!
Your chances seem better than mine lol
"Guess I was wrong about the stock going down today, honestly surprised by this thought the extra shares would cause dilution."
"While I respect the hustle, I still ask: why take profits at $21 when you could hold until August sales, quarterly earnings report, and everything that's coming over the next several years in the EV space? Current volatility is nothing compared to the ceiling on our investments here!"
Same! Stock will end green today! And sales announced tomorrw (I hope) should be at least 4k to meet thier targets.. but it will read as 20% increase over July
"Yeah at least I have a little more time, this dip right now isn‚Äôt looking too hot tho"
"Let‚Äôs not forget it was -8% at one point. I think the biggest risk for Nio was the continuity of the firm. By selling shares yes dilution makes the stock go down but when you look further, the fundamentals stay the same and the cash position is enormously supported by the new share offering. In the end the secure position outweighs the dilution. I did not expect it as wel but as the position was in red and my faith in nio it‚Äôs continuity increased I bought together with a lot of others I assume."
"The secondary offering was priced at $17 so it wasn‚Äôt terribly likely the stock price would drop much below that. Probably a lot of institutional investors waiting to pounce on it at that price, honestly."
"I don't expect good deliveries in August, as they are launching the new model I september. If it was me buying a car I'd wait a month for a new model. I could be wrong tho. 

They could share their preorders, which would be good news!"
Hey what a comeback ?! NIO going to 19?!?
"Well they just confirmed qtr quidance on the last call.. so they would know August #s. They confirmed 11k to 11.5, and July was 3.5.. which means August should be 4k."
Haha yeah let‚Äôs go. TSLA probably helping a bit?
This is a good buying opportunity to buy NIO on the dip before price hit mid $20 range
"People keep calling it dilution, and while there will be more shares, it has been known for months and it's to buy back most of the 25% of NIO China given up when NIO almost went bankrupt."
"They just announced 88m other shares, additional to the previous 75m, stock price is about to go dooooown"
I dont think this is another 88M shares.. its 88M vs 75M due to high demand they always allow a little more
This stock is going up 100% Don't worry about this it irrelevant.
"compulsory rocket ship

someone please post when this dude turns bearish. that‚Äôs when i‚Äôll freak out and sell."
is it plus 75 mil or 75 mil total? Do the 75 mil shares drop at one time or are they put online in increments? Also is it going to be on monday opening bell?
Im holding this stock in my coffee can and i will buy dips. It would be less stressful to people to crazy out if the stock goes -15%. Just hold it deinstall you Broker app and come in two years or just sell it. But some guys need to chill out and stop panicking
When will these stocks be on the market? Should we expect this to decrease the price of the stocks?
They are dumping on us üëÄ
Another 88 millions share coming. Wow üòØüëÄ
I love NIO. But we‚Äôre going down for sure!
https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-announces-pricing-offering-88500000-american
Yes you‚Äôre absolutely right!! In the long term
Not sure I think all 75 mil shares coming online tomorrow at opening bell
I‚Äôm buying the dip
Nope
Get your space suit on
"I think it may go to around 17, but total guess especially with deliveries announcement and convertible notes happening in the same week. 

I‚Äôd sell."
"There may be a drop towards $17 tomorrow due to that being the pricing of the huge offering. But then (assuming overall market is not going down) stabilization and possible increase, especially anticipating release of August delivery numbers before the end of the week. If they were to release the EC6 pre-order numbers that could really shoot things up. But that seems to not be their style. Also, if they were going to do that I would think they would have done so before the offering. By the way, I fully agree with your long-term bullish assessment. Hard to time the best flip but my sense is that you‚Äôre in a good position for tomorrow given the $17 offering."
"I'm also bullish on Nio, before the covid-19 situation, I already went to China several times for internships and saw Nios on the road (while driving on the highway), its prospects are good at least for now. I'm planning on holding my small position for 3 years with the possibility of adding more."
Buy more this Monday. That's NIO's final call before the rocket flies off on Tuesday morning.
I gotta see what size i'll need! need plenty of room in the pockets $$
praying it goes down. I got oct and jan $21 spreads but i gotta load up on more shares before it goes up again
"I just want to remind the group here that NIO posted an absolute KILLER of a quarter and we ended the day down like 5-10%... NIO, is the only other company putting impressive numbers (from what I can tell), but is trading significantly lower than XPENG and for the love of god WAY lower than Nikola who has yet to produce a red cent in revenue.."
"Same here, gonna buy more today when the market opens, that $17 do be looking sexy"
He speak tha Tru-Tru
Just buy more if it does.
Not necessarily but short term it will tend towards it.
"Assuming $17.00 is correct this actually suggests the stock won‚Äôt go quite that low, as secondary offerings are meant to be a slight discount."
"Just stop. The stock was 11-15 not too long ago, it wont drop past 16."
"Why did the share price drop when this came out. This was a funding round, so it's good news."
"Probably panic sellers. Part of it may come down to new investors who aren‚Äôt properly educated on secondary offerings and get scared off by the mention of dilution. Others may have sold off when they saw the price dropping hoping to take some gains and buy back in lower than they sold. That‚Äôs my speculation, anyway."
EXACTLY
Buy and then wait. Dont wait then buy.
Or also ask us to predict where it will be in a year.?  Or why did it drop $2 in a day.  You c ant always make sense of stock prices and they will be unpredictable.
"It's more of a matter of trader vs. investor mentality. As an investor, I believe the stock will go up in the future; therefore, rather than trying to time entry points, the main priority should be accumulating more shares."
exactly. people really be thinking short term...
What was the saying? Time in the markets beats timing the market. You may wait for a price that will never be seen again
"I bought 1k shares @18.73. I originally owned this @6 and got out @8. In the long run, I think it's undervalued @18. This is a LONG term play. If you're looking for a short play, $18 is expensive. Long term it's a value. GL"
They‚Äôll ask the same question when it hits $100 too lol
"I try to be an investor but I did put in all my money at 8, I made a lot of profit , but than I am getting stressed to lose a lot after a run up so I sold Friday, otherwise I get hart problems"
Thanks for saying this. Its very hard to watch amateur investors try to guess stonks. We all know the stonks will just go up stop asking ?
"Blame it on the mods, for letting people make those annoying posts."
"I saw nio $1.20.....i looked at it...then  i read people saying china companies this and that, bankrupt and so on..and...so on...so what did i do?  I did not take any position."
Of course it could go down.  All stocks go down.  But it will go back up.
"And they will continue to ask the same question when it hits 45, 50, 60, 80, 100 and beyond."
Anyone doing well on calls?  I saw someone had mad like 11k off calls.  New to investing. My schwabb app has calls but i dont want to lose my meagee 33 shares I grabbed at $3.
"I wish they would stop saying  "" its backed by the Chinese government"""
I‚Äôm still waiting for it to pull back to 7 üòâüòÇ
Yes sir anything below $20 is a go for me rn.
"My thoughts exactly. I bought at $13.11, $15, and today at $18.44. These numbers are small compared to the ceiling on the EV market over the next few years. Get in and hold onto it, buy the dip, just buy and hold!"
Exactly. Like what's the mentality here just hold the god damn shares dude!
"You can put back half of your profit, if it goes up good and if tanks, you will still be fine."
Wimp. Go buy a CD.
If you bought calls you would be so close to retirement right now
F
Your 33 @ $3 won‚Äôt be affected if you buy call options. They‚Äôre separate.
">Anyone doing well on calls?  I saw someone had mad like 11k off calls.  New to investing. My schwabb app has calls but i dont want to lose my meagee 33 shares I grabbed at $3.

a guy in my facebook group made 40k off of calls he bought for $600 back when NIO was like a dollar stock or something. so yes, there out there they just dont post on reddit"
Well...The nio China entity is 25% owned by the Chinese Hefei local government
im pretty sure china put a subsidy provision just for nio's baas cars. china needs EV more than EV needs china.
You've got the right username then bud lol
Thanks will put some money back this week
Lol
Pretty much sums up my entire investing journey.
Thanks. Still trying to learn so I appreciate the input.
What‚Äôs ur fb group? I want in
"Yes, but of which a lot of that will be bought back with this latest public offering."
I'm just sick of reading it that's all. Broken record
its the biggest one on facebook just search nio shareholder facebook group and ask to join
Of course but the government still believed in the company to take a stake and whilst this as not a big deal as some like to claim it‚Äôs still another favourable item to note.
most of it.
"Hi just sick of reading it that's all, I'm Dadüë®"
proof? all I know is u made up this rumor lol
Nope and doesn't sound very realistic.
"The only thing I've read is about the charging stations, isn't it? They must have universal connectors or something."
Source?
"Tesla Model 3, July sales is more than 3x that of NIO. Let's not count all the other EV makers in China. 

It's impossible for the govt to have such ridiculous policy."
Nah the government just encourages battery swapping. Whether it will be mandated in the future is a big question mark.
Does Anyone else besides NIO offer battery swap?
"Yes, BJEV. It has more swapping stations, like 209. But caters mainly to 16,000 taxis."
is this sub crowded by lotto players?

"I don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôll happen but when it happens, stock prices are going crazy"
Hoping this week.
Chinese company manufacturing numbers are out Monday according to T212
Only one way to find out
"Seems like it.

Diamond hands üíé 
..."
Looking at past reports they post within 3 working days of the new month
That‚Äôs what they said last month
"Monday is the last day of Aug (8/31). 

Even if China timezone is many hours before EST, it's not feasible for such early release.

According to the last few delivery report dates:

|April Delivery  |May 6th|
|:-|:-|
|May Delivery   |June 4th|
|June Delivery   |July 2nd|
|July Delivery   |Aug 3rd|

August delivery report is most likely on the first week of September. It could be delayed to 2nd week too."
Well the stock is up 50% since then as well.
Pre market it went crazy and dropped because some biggies cashed out and probably rebought
My bad must have got mixed up with smt else
"When will Nio buy back shares? 75.000,000 Ads offering they announced that some of the money will be used to rebuy shares.

How does this work ? Does Nio have to buy them back at a specific day? Or is it just buy whenever u want also it‚Äôs pretty dumb to wait wouldn‚Äôt it be the smartest move to just buy all of them on Monday and this way give Nio momentum and most likely push the stock up a bit?

I‚Äôm pretty new to this and don‚Äôt know much about SEC fillings"
$100 one year from now? That‚Äôs what analysts are predicting
"even if chinese govt stop subsidy, the fact that electric cars get instant approval (instead of lottery system) for its car registration in China is good reason to get an ev in china. also Nio has chinese govt investing in it as well, subsidies will continue to persist as it helps in car sales"
Cheers
"The Chinese government is trying to encourage battery swapping, so I don't think subsidy for Nio will fade out very soon."
Take this award Nio makes me rich
I don‚Äôt think it will get delisted. Chinese companies listing on American exchanges furthers the dollar hegemony which plays into the US money printing and doing whatever they want. It‚Äôs the same with the petrodollar
" NIO is and will continiously be the no. 1 EV maker in China. The tech innnovation like Baas and self driving with mobile eye is out of this world, not to mention the lifestyle experience that comes.with the car and Chinese love that. That said it is important for them to launch the ET7 and add this to their fleet to compete in the sedan market. I have seen the car and its stunning, so no doubt it will gain much popularity!! Both xpeng and Li both face quality concerns as mid august their cars caught fire on China highway! NIO the one and only!! As for stock its difficult to say where it will be considering all...if Tesla is the benchmark than there is a lot of potential upwards and current stock price is lower than actual valuation in terms of car sales..for the short term a usd 30 would be fair price. Further down the road who knows...profitability will be expected much sooner than Tesla made in the years after IPO so taken that into consideration the upside potential next year will be huge  
...but again..competition, trading, it will affect the stock in a way...most important in the EV industry is to keep ahead of competition with tech innovation and NIO simply does that"
You guys think nio will hit 1k + like Tesla?
for sure
good
Let's be rich.
hope so
"The US versions of Chinese stocks are holding companies.  

Not sure what that means for any of this, but,,,,,"
Be content it even reaches $100.
"You probably don't understand how share price work. NIO hitting $1,000 a share implies valuation of $1 trillion (notwithstanding potential further dilution as is common in Asian equity markets). Tesla is at $25 bln in revenues for $425 billion enterprise value. Individual companies have policies regarding where they want the share price to be. Not too liquid and they'll let the price go up (or reverse split). Very liquid and they'll aim for stock splits when it gets too expensive. Obviously fractional trading has changed the game a bit but robinhood traders are still a very small minority."
Not sure but NIO is a serious player.
No... and Tesla is wayyyy over valued
Oh dear..
No. Nio is a car company. Tesla is a software company building a car. Tesla also has multiple revenue streams. Nio just sells tshirts
What happens if it's delisted?
"Yes, all they sell is T-shirts. Must be awful to be a competitor with out battery swap technology. Enjoy waiting 3 hours for your battery to charge."
"Tesla's automobile sales accounts for 80-82% of its total sales yet you say its a software company. Some tesla fans are really delusional. If you're vested in its stock thats fine, dont spout nonsense."
"i can always can my bank to buy it in HK assumes it will IPO like bava. in fact CEO said so b4, no worries. it is simply capitalism."
"You realize there's a 45+ minute wait period to get your battery swapped, right? You can't just drive up. Their stations are overwhelmed. So wtf are you talking about?"
k
Soooo you don‚Äôt think that can be sorted out? You think that‚Äôs a permanent problem that can‚Äôt be easily solved?
Not gonna justify how its not a car company? Well then.
"Please, do explain how they will solve the problem when they are selling 1 million cars a year.. I'll wait"
"Do you not know how things work? You can still charge it like any other EV. In the mean time, they‚Äôll put the necessary infrastructure to make it as efficient as possible."
"Are you illiterate? I'm asking you in response to your direct comment about their swapping stations after you said, ""have fun charging your car for 3 hours"". Just shut up while you're ahead."
"Can you not read between the lines? Seems like you‚Äôre the illiterate one. ThEy WiLl PuT ThE InFrAsTrUtUrE necessary in due time... until then, you have the option to charge it normally. I know it‚Äôs hard for you to understand so let me say it again... the 45 minute wait you claim will be less once the swapping stations become more abundant. Until then, you can charge it overnight from your home. There is a reason analysts all over are recanting their price targets."
"Great points. I think we both are arguing over the same thing. Anyways, NIO to the moon. God knows I'm heavily invested lol"
I see you're bullish on nio. Why do you think it can hit $100. Genuinely curious. Im a little vested in nio but im very skeptical about the scalability of baas.
"Huge if true.  Reduce outstanding shares, get rid of the convertible notes."
Thanks for sharing. Do you have the source link?
Buy the dips
Can i have the source?
"with net proceeds from the shares being issues we are looking at USD 1,5B at best. the Hefei stake alone currently is worth ~ USD 5,3 B. as per NIO‚Äòs statement in the ir section, they plan to mainly (not only!) increase the share capital of and the company‚Äòs ownership in NIO China. Now, as per my calculation at current price, NIO ADR can increase its stake in NIO China by 7% max (but they dont put all the cash in increasing the ownership in NIO China, hence I suggest to rather consider 5% increase max)."
">Weilai stake to China increased by 10.5%, revenues increased by 10.5%! In the second quarter, Weilai sold 10,331 vehicles, with an average unit price of 450,000 and total revenue of 4.65 billion, but it was only 46.5\*0.749=3.5 billion on Weilai‚Äôs account. After the 10.5% equity redemption, the total revenue in China in the third quarter will increase by 10.5% out of thin air. According to 12,000 vehicles, the average unit price is 450,000, and the gross income from selling cars is 1.2\*45\*0.864=4.666 billion! And because the redemption price difference per share is 17 US dollars \* 40 million US dollars = 680 million US dollars \* 0.915 = 620 million US dollars = 4.28 billion yuan, the one-time financial net income is 4.28 billion yuan (after deducting the share capital and 8.5% interest expenses to Hefei )! After the third quarter earnings report, the stock price stood above $30! Genius, Li Bin, Feng Wei! Generous Hefei SASAC! Win three!

True if big"
"All things considered, the market indicates that it will settle between 16.5 to $19, and then start to rise over time. Whether it's $16 or $25, get in and buy as in the mid to long term, you're not going to lose. Feel free to day trade in and out, but it's still very volatile at this point to know when it will rise or drop. China is going gangbusters and as long as the USD keeps printing (devaluation), the bigger China is getting. Get ready to change your battery soon!"
"There's violent price fluctuation incoming either next week or the week after.

\---

According to a friend in China: When he attended the opening of the 150th NIO House, the people in-charged said the backorder for NIO EV is at record levels. This means, NIO delivery for August = maximum production. At minimum, it should par with July delivery. Best case, it'll break 4000. Bullish.

Based on [this](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-announces-us235-million-private-placements-short), 235 million will be changed into NIO shares at $3.5 or lower. Using simple maths, that'd be another 67 million shares dilution on Sept 5th. This can lead to about 5% drop in price on Monday Sept 7th or later. Bearish.

\---

If NIO releases Aug delivery next week, we can expect a price spike, followed by a price down next Monday. Going to be a roller-coaster ride.

If NIO release Aug delivery the week after, it'll mostly end up as a pre-market pump, followed by a dump at market open. Assuming panic selling, price may crash badly.

\---

This is my personal opinion and should be taken as hearsay, not facts nor financial advice."
Dilution isnt really a problem imo. Its more about analysts being bearish on nio's baas strategy. I'd hold instead of buying/selling for now.
It'll either go up or down.
(partially) buying out Hefei Gov. at the price of some dilution is peanuts imo
"Shit, I‚Äôm scared"
Nio should really rethink about building its own factory.
It could be the same
No shit Sherlock
"There's nothing to be scared.

If you are holding long term, price fluctuations is expected, especially for NIO where IV is over 100. In fact, I know many happy people waiting to buy the dip.

If you have calls, the date for convertible notes is fixed, so price is not going to be affected by it until Monday Sept 7th. Close your positions on Friday Sept 4. Just don't blame me if price rises next week."
"We all are, let‚Äôs all hope he‚Äôs wrong even though he‚Äôs probably right"
"Actually no. If NIO has it's own factory, it needs even more money to expand.

Look at Tesla, building a bunch of giga factories, but until they are build, production is capped by the current ones.

NIO doesn't need to spend on building factories. JAC will be the one doing so. This allows NIO to expand faster."
Yes shit Holmes
"Like me, I‚Äôm dying for it to get around 17$"
Which day should I buy it?
"No. I'd rather they fund one now than say 2025 or 2030. If you're thinking long term, not having your own factory or factories now will be a liability in future, it affects scalability.

Nio is probably capped by its current contract with JAC, ironically.

Speaking of Tesla. Look at how fast giga shanghai was built. What do you think will happen after all gigafactories are operational."
"You present this as if there are no downsides. The primarily cost is to the gross margin. And changes are relatively cumbersome requiring negotiations with someone else.

Tesla does this because they want to expand the fastest while receiving a higher margin. If NIO‚Äôs growth is genuine, there shouldn‚Äôt be an issue raising the capital necessary for expansion."
"Stocks can only go down or up so thats the same as saying that the earth is spinning around the sun, it‚Äôs a fact"
"I can show you a way to get shares cheaper IF you are buying them in 100s and holding them long term.

Sell ITM Puts.

\----

Example:

Instead of buying NIO at the current price of $18.50, 

Sell Put, Strike $20, Expiry 9/11 ; 100 shares per option.

The premium should be around $2.5 on Monday assuming no drastic price change. Although you will be paying $20 per share, but considering you get $2.5/share from the option premium, the overall cost is lower than buying shares directly.

What if NIO price is above $20 on 9/11? You get to keep the premium as profit. pretty much a win-win situation.

You can also adjust the strike price depending on your desire to own the shares. 

* Strikes at $19 or $18 has a lower chance to stay ITM, but gives you a much better price if assigned.
* Strikes above $20, higher chance to get the shares, but less cost reduction.

\----

How to use:

When you think NIO reaches its lowest point. Sell put at that time. This will let you own shares at an even lower price assuming the option expires in the money. 

If price rocket upwards, you make money... which isn't bad. Keep selling puts until you get assigned.

If price goes down further... well, you are bullish on NIO long term, just didn't get it at the lowest point. No biggie."
"Tesla is omni-directionally integrated. Their business model is very strong and able to profit from almost everything related to their EV. From manufacturing to selling, even software, insurance and maintenance. However, to get to where it is today takes time. Tesla has IPO over a decade. 

NIO, on the other hand, acts like a string, connecting up all the individual dots to create something great. JAC is the first, for manufacturing cars. They then partner with Sunning for better exposure of NIO Space. They also join forces with CATL for BaaS. They even collaborate with Intel/MobilEye for autonomous driving.

From a general perspective, NIO is losing profitability with each new partner. JAC takes a cut from manufacturing; For BaaS, NIO only retains 25%. Don't know the details for Sunning and MobilEye... but I don't think they're going be free. However, looking from another perspective, if NIO does things all by itself - like Tesla, it'll most probably not be where it is today.

This is the difference in Business Model of the two companies, which is also the reason why NIO can expand that rapidly. 

\----

As for capacity, even if NIO own it's own factories, they will still be capped. Back in early 2019, when the company is at its low, I don't think NIO will build something the scale of Giga-Shanghai.

Building new factories to raise capacity take years. By outsourcing, NIO can announced they're raising capacity in September this year, leaving the details (headaches) to JAC."
"At least volkswagen went into a joint venture with jac to build a new plant. Sharing capacity with jac own product line is very limiting, long term."
Plethora of low quality posts plaguing this subreddit..
all the seller are gonna be regret.
"I think the bottom was in at $18, and once they announce the first set of German sales numbers within the next few months, we are looking at $30 easy. And once again I must point out the fact that the Dollar is getting weaker by the day, any stocks whose revenue is in RMB or Euros will also benefit from the exchange rate. Long live NIO and GLTA."
New investor here. Got 200 shares. Question for more seasoned people here.....where do we think the stock will be in end of the year?
"Everyone prepare to buy some shares from Monday to Thursday, they might get as low as high $16"
Is it going to pass 22 next week or what??
"Yeah, still better then Yahoo finance, people there really are delusional and thinking that their 10 shares of nio has any effect on the market. Also NIO is down about 13% from all times high and people are panicking. It is very funny to watch."
Downvote and block is my new reflex on this sub.
"It is to show that there are a lot of new NIO stock traders who are unfamiliar with stocks and/or NIO. I don‚Äôt condone ‚Äúdumb questions‚Äù because not everyone is on the same level of knowledge capacity (not intellectually) and not everyone started stocks at the same time, but I do feel like posts with claims SHOULD include a source LINK or else it won‚Äôt be approved to be posted. Reddit is a discussion forum after all, we just have a dynamic of experience and perception."
You think they will be selling cars in Germany before the end of 2020?
"Realistically 30-35 and it think next summer it‚Äôll see bonkers growth, unless something Covid-ish strikes again."
conservatively 40-50 but sky's the limit...can be 100+ to the moon :))
I believe the shares will jump up again by the time they release their next report in November
I'm not sure if prices will get that low next week with July production numbers due. But Its nice to hope.
This lol. It just blew up 50% in 2 days calm the fuck down folks
My job as a mod is almost as if i need to delete 99% of posts. Hard to keep up.
"LOL

You must post on Stocktwits a lot. 

ACTUALLY conservatively, 25. That would be a 20% growth (about) from ATH this year. You‚Äôre saying that CONSERVATIVELY, you think you‚Äôll see 100% or 150% growth? Go back to stocktwits."
Doubled stock price is called being conservative. Well then.
So stay strapped tf in? And buy more ok
If Nio Day is a go for December that could be a major boost as well. I expect a lot will change over the next three earnings reports.
Also we should expect August delivery numbers next week. Most likely Wednesday or something
"So, do you think it‚Äôll never reach $16 or just not this week but in the next ones?"
"bunch of new investors that literally just bought nio. If you brought nio at 2$ you‚Äôre big chillin, I bought nio around 14$ and I‚Äôm big chillin"
"Yes, unfortunately that's what needs to be done.

I tried to make people think before posting but it didn't go far."
"I know NIO isnt TSLA yet but Jan 2013 TSLA @ $35 and EOY $150, a 428% increase.

NIO had a 600% growth within this 52 wks. so it's not impossible for it to get another growth spike at EOY. We'll have to see the upcoming weeks sales report and hope for the best. Cheers :)"
September deliveries will be the one to watch.
I think $16 is gone buddy. Never to be seen again. Couldn‚Äôt even touch sub $18 on the dump. Too many people want to be invested in NIO.
Personally I think I'm not paid to think on where the price will be in X time. I just worry about being positioned to take advantage of the trend and to limit the downside risk.
"I bought nio at 19.50$ and I'm big chillin, this company gon be biiiig"
Asking some of these folks to think for the first time in their existence is a difficult feat. Appreciate the few like yourself on the sub though!
Indeed
Then should I buy at 18 or lower if it happens to go down?
"Well of course if it dips, use it as a buying opportunity. I own 1280 shares at $12.70. I plan on having at least 1500-1700 and will consider averaging up on Monday. There could be a potential dip opportunity. We shall see"
"I completely agree, we will be all waiting for it to dip on monday and Tuesday, let‚Äôs suppose it tips to 17.50, how approximately much time would it take to get to around 22 dollars?"
"How long is a piece of string, if we knew these answers we‚Äôd be millionaires"
Twice as long as half of its lenght
" I'm looking at the chart, Very Bullish. Great news on global expansion and repurchase of ownership. it means more profits for investors like us. My chart is telling me Davidnio is ON THE MONEY. I'm seeing $25 next week which he predicted 2 months ago. Follow the smart people here not the trolls."
"This is the announcement from August 20, NIO just posted this on YouTube."
This will get crushed during battery day. We shall see.
"So you‚Äôre telling me that 1 NIO will cost 25 US dollars in a week time? If so, would it be a good decision to buy it as soon as the market opens, on Monday?"
BLUE SKY IS COMINüöÄ
"Yea right...elon seems to promise a lot but usually don‚Äôt deliver, yet his fanboys and gals keep giving him a pass. Where is FSD?? Tesla‚Äôs are still colliding with parked vehicles! Wake up"
should have brought yesterday on friday when it was 18$ brother
It is probably going under 18 little after the market opens
does it really matter if you‚Äôre holding long term??
"I am holding medium-long term, around 1 - 1.5 years"
I‚Äôd ride the tsla through the split then buy NIO next week.
"I already sold Tsla and bought with the money more NIO stock, i have bought 1000 Shares and im bullish on NIO. I think NIO gonna succesful like TSLA. And yeah im gonna buy some tesla stock after the split."
"It is my belief that Nio themselves are bullish. Releasing the public offering news a week or less before the august numbers and preorders for the new car, is, in my opinion, all part of the chess game. The good news will have greater effect of the sp after a nearly a 10% drop. And that is why i believe that next friday we will be closing around 24-25$. 

&#x200B;

Just a theory, reply with what you think."
"I have this friend that thinks I'm his good luck charm because he always has a winning day at the casino whenever I accompany him. Really, it's because I'm not a gambler and as soon as he is up I start nagging him about taking his winnings and going home."
I have the same dilemma.
Just buy both and hold. It‚Äôs pretty clear both companies are selling what we will certainly be using in the near future. It‚Äôs the best long term play any of us could possibly make.  It‚Äôs almost like getting into APPL before they announced the IPhone.
"You‚Äôre not crazy for thinking about changing positions at any given time. Investing is complex and should always require constantly changing thought. However, you ARE crazy for thinking that the opinions of those who read your reddit post that starts with ‚Äúalright boys‚Äù is going to be better advice than you could come up with for yourself. Teach yourself somthing new every single day. Strive to learn and you wont need the advice of social media on what to do with your money."
"Yeah, I'm thinking this is the move. I definitely want to get in on more before the August numbers drop. Hopefully it won't suddenly rocket next week before I can execute a play."
I agree with you.
"I thought exactly the same today. The stock dilution before delivery numbers, all part of a bigger play"
"Hahaha... alright, respect."
Tsla has a good chance of going up pretty good after the split with the lower price IMO. There‚Äôs a good amount of people waiting to add it to their portfolio and the low price instead of a partial will be a good catch.
Also battery day is a month away for Tesla id wait to sell after that.
This.
"It all should go well, just that the UK T212 ISA NIO drop may effect the prices.."
I hate short sellers üòÖ
Love these threads. More posts equals more interest. Abolish the daily discussion.
Ez put money
Who the hell is panic selling? Why weren't you morons buying this under $4/share? Anyone here who has an average so high they're getting nervous with NIO at $19 deserves to get rekt.
Another post that should be a comment on the daily discussion.
When do new cars get released ?
"As someone who was forced to sell. This comming dip is giving me a safer place to buy back in + the gains I took from selling.

Really annoying to loose such a low average. Cost... but hay-ho!"
No one even knows what this means. Usa moves stocks.
What's this about? NIO is the biggest position I hold in my T212 ISA
üòÇ
"Have you been living under a rock and missing all the recent posts on WSB , R/stocks and all? And some people like myself did not know about NIO when it was that cheap."
Keep up the fight brother!
We have the latest SUV go into production last month and a 4 door sedan is planned for next year.
I wonder how the diluation will move it tho..
"I actually unsubbed from r/nio a couple months ago because all the WSB kids started showing up in each thread every day like ""WHEN $10?"" I look forward to when this stock gets boring again because that's when I'll be loading up more shares."
Selfishly hoping for around for around $16.  That looks the bottom of this wave?
"Someone said, that they are asking for 20.44 for them, no lower. Don't quote me on this tho. Right now its people panic selling for real, many taking tendies before the weekend. That's why we are at the dip atm i think."
"they already sold those shares for 20.44. Now nio has 1.5B in cash to buy back they share in Nio China from Hefei government , which means more profit in the long run for shareholders. P.S. If today Nio tanks less then 7%(dilliusion size)  that means that we actually increased in value"
"Ah, thank you"
"20.44 is the estimated price for offering and no, thw shares haven't been sold yet. actual offering price will be released once sold."
What do you mean exactly by ‚Äúlong run‚Äù should I be ok buying them for 18.70 and selling them in a two month time?
My avg price is 5.10 usd. Started to buy around 3 usd. I have close to 10k shares. Buying at 18.70 should still be okay. IMO if market (or Tesla) don't crash in for coming 2-3 months we might see 30 and up. At the moment NIO is 2nd biggest luxury EV car manufacturer in the world and China has a lot bigger middle class then USA + didn't suffered from corona that much. Just invest with money you aren't afraid to loose this is still risky investment.
I bought another 100 shares today
Im slowing adding.. my hope is we see $16-$17 this week
Yeah I‚Äôm not gonna bite at 19.
Yeah I'm like one click away from doing the same thing lol
How much are you guys willing to lose if nio lets us down ?
"I have 200 shares. I am holding on to it long term. Until then, I will sell covered calls to make some premium."
How much does everyone think NIO will be worth in next friday?
same
"For how much, i got myself 73 shares for 18.63 a piece, good deal or nah?"
"Better than nothing. 19 might be the new bottom, its barely gone below it"
Youre gonna regret that when it ups to 30 in 3 months
"Me personally don't belive the company will fail. It might go sideways for a long time. With nio I'm like, going up = good. Going down to 10-12$ again = buy a lot more.

I strongly belive it will hit 100 within a few years and a few hundreds in 5-10 years.

They have huge potential long term as a lifestyle company and not only as an EV company"
Not sure... How long is a piece of string though?
18.72
"Good deal was when it was neutral around 12 for a whole month.

But buy high and sell low, right fellas?"
I‚Äôm gonna HODL!
"You right, it‚Äôs dipping 18.40 now though."
Fair enough good luck hopefully it pays of in the end
18.63 now
"Thanks sir, and good luck to you too if you are holding!"
"Aw yeah, I bought back in at 18.50 and I‚Äôm gonna hold. I‚Äôll buy more if it dips. 

I don‚Äôt have a lot of money like most people, I‚Äôm sitting on 10 shares now. If it blows up to 1000 though, woooo! Lol"
"Uhh, 1000 is veeeeeeery distant, we‚Äôre talking about like 10 years, even more and that is without any risk or diluted stock"
"Oh I wasn‚Äôt saying it would reach 1k, I was saying that was the exception to someone with my small amount of shares actually making a decent amount to ‚Äúplay with.‚Äù"
"Oh, If you‚Äôre a beginner 10 shares is just fine, if you‚Äôre already experienced with the stock market have some fun!
You probably already know but don‚Äôt put more than you ‚Äúcan‚Äù in stocks, I know many people that have lost tons of cash like that"
"Yeah, super beginner. I‚Äôve seen it as a money pit for some.  

Work at a bank, and I‚Äôll most likely go the investment route with ETFs and such. Right now I‚Äôm just planning on adding 25 a paycheck in addition to my 401k contribution to gamble with."
No wonder the stock price is tanking in AH
This is actually good news.. they need cash for growth. I like it.
"16.3-16.4$ is at the convergence between the short term 0.68 fib and the macro 0.236, which would make this dilution a perfect timing for a healthy retracement on the next couple of days before going back up with August delivery numbers."
Short term bearish. Tesla went up with their offering but NIO is no tesla and the rep/loyalty is not there yet. Good for NIO though capitalizing on the last few days of craziness. BofA upgrading NIO and then underwriting the offering thoughü§î
"Yeah more dilution.

&#x200B;

Short term the stock price is going to take a hit. Kind of sucks because we had a great rally up the past few days, but long term this move makes a lot of sense.

&#x200B;

It's pretty much a sad now, happy later situation for us stock investors. 3 years from now we could be thanking them for doing this."
good for the long run. NIO always hunger for cash.
Question is do i sell or ride it out..
Sell now and reinvest when it drops?
I fucking bought 10k at $20.34 üòµ
"Also, 9/5 more shares from bond holders will be sold.  Overall, it is a small percentage of total share, to be fair."
It‚Äôs only 6% of shares not too bad. Will provide them with gains to push forward product and r&d
"Totoal is 1B shares, this just a beginning.  But why no reaction on August 20th when the sec filling happened? https://ir.nio.com/node/7646/html"
"The dilution is about 11% it seems, the price has not been announced yet but likely to be the closing price within a couple of days ago. The last time this happened in June the stock dropped a bit then gone up significantly. In the press release it said the money will be used to buy back shares and to develop autonomous driving so I guess that's good news somehow."
"Great opportunity to buy more shares ü§ë
Thank you NIO for another discountsüöÄ"
"Noooo, my put credit spreads! There goes my collateral  :("
Dilution
This is from 9 June.

"I wanted to buy after the rally but last rally I did the same and got the feel how it moves. 
So now I wait for the dillution to top up! As you say, on the long run it is not that bad. 
It is the second time this year they do this though."
"Talking about shares. Don't you think it is funny how analysts rate Nio versus Li Auto? 

I am not getting their reasoning. Li Auto is recommended with buy by most including nasty GS (they downgraded Nio a few weeks ago and the stock took a fall). Li Auto is rated with a buy and had a 23% run after that. It is a plain vanilla EV and I do not get how it can produce more value than NIO who is much more diversified."
They are taking the game to Tesla. One step backward but many potential steps forward for share price.
This also what i figured.  Where it broke out.
Nio is not Tesla...
Cool if there‚Äôs a dip are you planning to buy more?
No way this is a good buying opportunity for all of us.
What do you mean we could be thanking them? Why is this good for long term?
I'm riding. This will only help NIO to progress faster. I'm actually glad they're doing this.
I will ride this one out. I just went through one with gevo so I'm not fazed
I'm long nd ready to buy at the dip :)
That's what's I'm doing. Most likely will drop tomorrow morning due to panic sellers / dilution combined.
"you can either ride it out or sell for loss. depending on your strategy, a lot of us are long so we‚Äôll probably ride it out."
Same. YOLOd at $20.74üò≠
"Itll get back there and beyond, eventually"
That fomo life
Think it was slightly down that day. But anybody who remembered that registration and saw this run up this week shoulda seen the red flags.
Isn‚Äôt it more like 7%?
"
We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately US$1.497.4 million (or approximately US$1,722.2 million assuming the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full), at an assumed offering price of US$20.44 per ADS, which was the last reported closing price of our ADSs on August 26, 2020, after deducting underwriting commissions and fees and the estimated offering expenses payable by us."
"The share buyback is confusing, are they offering ADR to buy back voting right stocks in China?"
Mine are still far out... I have 2 spreads at 15/16 which are still itm and expire oct/nov. I have two more spreads at 20 which expire oct and jan
Proposed on June 9 but officialized on 08/27
"Why are you asking this? If someone knew where the bottom would be, they would sell everything they have and become filthy rich."
umm... didn't you read the part where he said that?
"I won't buy any more at the current moment, unless the cost per share drops below my cost basis. Only then would I consider it.

&#x200B;

It has more so to do with my personal plan than it is the company. If I had extra $$ laying around I would for sure put more into NIO, along with my other assets."
"I agree. Secondary offerings can be great buying opportunities, as long as you're in it for the long haul."
"right, guy ,i think you are right"
"Well the whole point of the offering is to raise more capital. By offering 75m shares, they can raise north of 1B USD, assuming they sell the shares for greater than $13.3.

&#x200B;

I am assuming they will use this excess of 1B for the growth and expansion of the company. The extra cash reserve will also help in case things turn sour for a little while. When you consider that they are looking to expand into the European markets, having an extra margin of safety to go along with a greater cash repository will only do wonders going forward.

&#x200B;

So whats the consequence? Well in the short term, the price of the shares are going to drop due to the dilution. Long term however, this offering could be what provides them the edge in a successful expansion.."
You think so? Tell me its gonna be ok lol
Hate to see it drop down to $12-$13 again.
Why the fuck do I never hear about this important information until it‚Äôs too late lol
Hes making an indirect comparison. Do you have problems with reading comprehension?
"This is a terrible investment strategy. When a stock that you like drops, you should buy regardless if its above your cost basis. This is actually the only true way to make alot of money. Majority of people dont go all in with one purchase. You can make some but you wont make alot."
Thanks a lot for a very complete answer!
How much down and for how long?
"I guess this is like having a watermelon and adding more watermelon to it, making it bigger and more sellable?"
just average down if possible or slowly accumulate more shares
why not just average down if possible?
"Well, be wary whenever theres a huge spike in stock price and crazy bullish sentiment. As the person above stated, NIO still has alot more shares to issue"
You should stop trolling the sub man...
"Well in the afterhours the price is already at $18.06 (about a 9% drop). Based off of previous experiences with other secondary offerings, it would not surprise me to see NIO back down in the $15-16 range over the next several days.

&#x200B;

Truthfully however, it's hard to tell exactly where the price will end up in the next little bit. Most of this can be countered by pouring in some good news, and we just might get some of that next week when we hear the August sales numbes.

&#x200B;

A lot of times the short term investors are not too happy with secondary offerings. That's all I can say.

&#x200B;

There really is no reason to panic though. If you believed in this company before this offering was announced, then your belief in them should be even higher now solely due to the fact that they're about to add an extra 1B cash reserve.

Same company, but more money to spend on growth. I like my chances."
"Why do people ask questions like this? If someome knew, they would sell every possession they had and become filthy rich."
"I have 438 shares at $13.70 average.  I could make roughly $1,900 if I sold at opening and reinvest I guess."
if you know a stock is gonna fall you will make so much more money in the short term by selling and rebuying than avergeing down
Why not sell calls against your stock to get your average down.  Likely covered calls will be profitable in the next month or so while NIO retraces to mid teens
"Just a quick question. 

How do we know what price offered is at for this dilution? Where can we see, or we can't see? Some reports say that it was being offered at 20.44 per each share while others say EOD's price at 19.88?"
"I was thinking maybe someone knows of a comparable situation that‚Äôs happened in the past to offer insight on what this may bring. You know, like how lawyers use past cases to present an argument for their case? I had hoping for something like that."
"I‚Äôd say calculate your net gain after accounting for capital gains tax and what you‚Äôd need NIO to drop to in order to make sure you can buy your 438 shares back without putting in additional capita

NIO closed at about 20, so it‚Äôd need about 35-40% drop to hit $12-13 which feels a little extreme. Who knows though"
if you have the capital just slowly buy more overtime or buy it under or close to your cost. this is for sure a long hold and i dont see any reason to sell and try snd tome it now especially how volatile this is. just my suggestion
Nobody knows for sure how much it will drop that‚Äôs the thing.
it's an at-the-market offering.  That means it'll be sold at the market price when the offering closes
"It's mostly speculation until it is confirmed. It can either be confirmed by the company itself, or by a source that has correspondence with the company.

Sometimes a company will announce a secondary offering but it won't actually take place until several days later. For example, Virgin Galactic announced a secondary offering during their last quarterly reports, just about 3.5 weeks ago. The price of the stock was around $23-$24 at the time. However, the offering itself didn't actually take place until a week later. The stock tanked a bit, but they were able to successfully close the secondary offering at $19.50 per share.

&#x200B;

I would like to believe in NIO's case that the secondary offering was indeed at $20.44, but we can't say for sure yet. A lot of the times, an investment firm or group of wealthy individuals reach out to a company and offer to buy X number of shares at X price, which can lead to secondary offerings. Thus, the offering price could be well decided before it is announced.

&#x200B;

We should know more in the coming days."

People that do this always say I wont buy yet. It will drop more. Then it jumps and they will say not buying when it goes up. Next thing you know its at $30. Happened to all the tsla sellers who tried to jump in and out. Will happen to the nio jumpers too.

"This is the first time one of the stocks I own has diluted its shares - does the price usually continue to drop until the offering is over, or is the initial news as big as the dip gets?"
I had 1 call for 20 dollars tomorrow. I lose 42 dollars probably but it was a learning experience.
"Are the new shares really going to be $20.44?
According to [this](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1736541/000110465920099693/tm2022004-6_424b5.htm) they are."

"Why you gotta hurt me so bad nio, what did I do to you"
I‚Äôm in at around $11 how low will shares go tmrw?
It's gonna soar on open cuz of all the stop losses getting triggered and then continue the downward thrust
"Govt of hefei and other minority interests initially bought into NIO China along with Nio Inc at an effective price of something like $1 a share back in March I believe. This single handedly saved Nio from going bankrupt so it was a great thing. But Nio Inc (the entity we all have shares in) was left with only 75% stake of NIO China (which owns all the NIO assets and intellectual property etc), with the govt and other minority interests holding the other 25%. The new money will go towards buying back a small part of the 25%, probably from the minority interests as opposed to the govts stake as I can't see the govt wanting to sell. It's funny, the minority interests are getting bought back out at a $20.44 price based on the SEC filing. From about $1 ish that's like a 20x gain in only 6 months."
PSA: Stocktwits is mainly for entertainment. Amazing amount of delusional crazies on there.
"Curious on advice. At the time of this comment, the stock price is at $18.26. I have 295 shares. Not worried about the dip because I know it will go up in the long term. But curious at what point I should buy more? I‚Äôm looking to add another 100 shares or so. Thoughts?"

"Lol, you have a spare 200k lying around. I think you'll be alright."
I just yeeted 8k in nio at $19.03
oof
You‚Äôll get it back
Imagine if nio sells the shares at an average of 24$ a share. Wouldn't this be really bullish? Also it would mean today's low was the best opportunity to purchase shares. I'm cash gang atm so im hoping the opposite happens this coming week and it dips to 17 and ill take a position
"Lol you will make it back in no time, unless you sold your stock already in fear. Then I would say you are an official retard"
"First day there is usually always a drop, eventually the market will forget about it and it will go back to price levels before dilution. This is a fairly decent dilution though at 7.5% but they are using some it to buy equity in NIO china so its really like a 5% dilution."
[deleted]
"If you invested because of fundamentals, no. If you invested to try and make a quick buck, yes."
"Long term, no.  I wish I could time these things, I would have sold my position at $20 and bought back in today.  I can't time for shit, so i guess I'm in a bit longer."
I think he meant that he spent $10K total
Can I ask why at close of market today? I would expect the price may continue to drop a little over next week as well.
"Large funds Are Not averse to investing in Nio, look at Bailey-Giffords 115,000,000 shares, Price Waterhouse Cooper does their accounting.... there are lists of institutional investors with large amounts of Nio ADR'S In their portfolio's, mostly they don't invest frivolously..... Sleep well...."
Just stay away from it if you believe Nio is going to be Luckin 2.0
"I think it‚Äôs a great question. NIO is audited by PWC China which could be cause for alarm. They aren‚Äôt subject to the same auditing as American Companies due to ‚Äúviolation of Chinese Secrecy Laws‚Äù 


https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSBREA0L28D20140123

However I also think it‚Äôs unfair to immediately think NIO is Luckin Coffee. It‚Äôs more difficult to fake vehicle sales than coffee sales.

While I‚Äôm continuing to buy more it is my biggest concern with the company. I‚Äôm long NIO and I‚Äôm not going to worry about a downtrend for the coming weeks. If you‚Äôre trying to day-trade good luck riding this animal

EDIT: accidentally flipped coffee sales and vehicle sales."
"as an auditor who worked at one of the big four accounting firms and dealt with pcaob inspections involving our Chinese counterparts, the statement is quite laughable. fyi pwc is probably the most reputational auditing firm on the world and the auditing standard applies to its global member firms for us listed companies. but ppl believe what they wanna believe."
It‚Äôs natural to internally be frustrated and create a lengthy post saying ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt I invest earlier‚Äù...but what are ya gonna do. Buy in now before it hits $30 next week
Your problem is you‚Äôre afraid. All the research is already out there and if you had done your due diligence or even a simple search in these forums you would have seen this question addressed many times already. Either hop on the train or don‚Äôt... nobody gonna do that for you.
"I know people can‚Äôt trust Chinese stocks anymore due to luckin but not all companies are like that. I suggest you should overcome the fear that they are all fraud. Also, you can still make decent money from short term or options. 
If you can‚Äôt handle fear you shouldn‚Äôt own stocks - warren buffet"

"Don't bother if you are not willing to take the risk. I have put in 1500 in it when it was at 3.8, knowing completely that I had written off my money. However, surprisingly they survived the pandemic and I am still holding on to the stock and its valued five-fold."
Why not?

"Come on, PWC China is not the same and you know this. I‚Äôm in B4 too, can‚Äôt bullshit a bullshitter."
"I am just speculating at this moment as new to investing, what makes you think Nio will hit $30 next week?

Yesterday was a record high of 100M Nio shorts, which is 28% of total volume, a pullback is imminent in this kind of scenario the price will drop down. 

What news did you hear thinking it would reach 30$ by next week?"
Not hitting $30 anytime soon it will hit $5 before it hits 30 new shares being issued
Zero chance it hits 30 next week
"Haha! 

NIO has actual vehicles on the road and not just a strong photoshop team. They also haven‚Äôt installed solar panels for the CEO and reported it as revenue.

i think less people are fooled by NKLA than Luckin Coffee. Milton himself says they‚Äôre going after ‚ÄúRobinhood traders‚Äù so I don‚Äôt think he has major investors fooled.

"Lmao. You twiddle your thumbs while it goes from $2 to $20 in 6 months. It‚Äôll be $30 in the next 6 months (probably double that). Be skeptical if you want, but the longer you wait the more FOMO you‚Äôll have. If you don‚Äôt want to invest just stop following NIO. Invest in Microsoft or Apple or Amazon instead."
"I personally don‚Äôt think it will hit $30, but if it did, my guess would be because of August deliveries and another analyst upgrade (looking at you Goldman Sachs). If I recall correctly, I think I read that CEO Li Bin stated he was expecting lower delivery numbers this month due to the release of the EC6 (tried to find the article, but couldn‚Äôt). It‚Äôs a long shot, but I kept a few hundred shares just incase."
Just because the amount of shorts grows does not mean the short sellers are right.
The new shares will be priced at $20.44 though.
Sell calls then which expire worthless if you're so confident
"I‚Äôm with you until the last point.
What constitutes a ‚Äòlarge‚Äô following, what does that even mean?"
How would Nio have a robotaxi network by Q3 of 2021?
I see someone has been browsing Yahoo finance board.
"Tips: Double enter for proper spacing when posting on mobile.

Most of your points makes little to no sense especially the robotaxi one in Q321.

Once Tesla has it, NIO may follow on 2 years later at best but for now, it's just an empty promise to hype the retail investors. Let's be realistic please."
"I am assuming he is talking about this - https://www.google.com/amp/s/thedriven.io/2020/08/07/australian-interest-in-china-ev-maker-nio-surges-past-tesla-for-its-stock/amp/

As for Europe, NIO is planning to sell their vehicles in Europe in 2021"
"If Tesla hasn't done it, I doubt NIO will have it by then.. Let's not get too ahead of ourselves please."
"Yes... I'm bullish about NIO, but seriously... Don't see it happening that soon"
" I have no idea where they Q3 2021 is coming from.

But mobileye is deploying robotaxis in early 2022, and Nio is one of the vehicle providers."
"They have a concept design called the NIO Eve, however, with government regulations and permits, if they have already built one Eve, they would still have to wait a bloody long time for the permits to be granted. They might have one test taxi initially (probably 2022), and a whole network by 2025. That's if they are actively pushing the boundaries of invention. 

I am sure for now, their focus is entirely on maximising sales"
Yeah considering thier partner mobile eye had stated 2022. Lets go with 2024.. does not mean it wont get priced in during 2022 if they release good news on it.
"I have no idea where they Q3 2021 is coming from.

But mobileye is deploying robotaxis in early 2022, and Nio is one of the vehicle providers.

Also in the robotaxi industry, Tesla is a nobody, and not a useful metric at all."
We don't even know if more popularity in stocks means more sales.
"Mobileye is making the robotaxi network in Israel and China and other places down the road as well as proving the technology.  Nio is just providing the vehicle and hardware integration.

Although the timing is incorrect. I don‚Äôt know where Q3 2021 is coming from. It should be Q1 2022."
Their partner mobileye has said they will use Nio cars in ‚Äúvery early 2022.‚Äù Which was moved up from their original timeframe. And they are currently ahead of schedule.
Do you think this could be enough of a push to cause a sell off?
What is a UKT212 ISA?
This is odd. Any more info?
Here is the link for where I first heard the news [NIO ISA Removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKInvesting/comments/ihhn1m/incase_you_didnt_know_trading212_has_to_remove/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
"Gutted, up over 50% yesterday, now the shares are been automatically sold off..."

"Well, I guess we‚Äôll see where I fair out on my 9/11 17.5C"
" In 2018, NIO claimed it would have 1100 swapping stations built by 2020. It fell short by approx 800-900 stations. OK, optimism can be a good thing unless it‚Äôs Tesla size."
Lucky i copped on a t212 invest
They  say it‚Äôs closing on the 1st of September. So I assume you can hold on till then.
Hehe this looks like a copy cat of the Facebook group
"Don't think they're significant enough. From the facebook group I joined, most seem to be like Robinhood investors."
An ISA is a tax wrapper for people in the UK.  Allows us to invest up to ¬£20k a year and not pay any tax on the growth.
I'm going to rebuy using a regular invest account.
"but this was before the bailout.....up until today we have 160s plus next year 5 per week beeing built.   
It¬¥s a good number imo for end of 2021.  
The chinese government can ramp this up anytime."
Oh wow so why would the shares be sold today?
"Me too, hopefully it dips a bit today and we can get some shares a bit cheaper!"
Be careful since T212 normally takes a day or two to clear the money into a new account.
Same question
Just spoke to them over chat. All NIO will be sold within 4 hours. You can move the cash over to invest and rebuy.
"You can normally reinvest straight away, it's just if you want to withdraw funds that you have to wait the 2 days (I think)"
Something to do with the fact they're listed on an ADR which cant be held in an ISA for tax reasons
I quickly sold at $20.01 on open.  Going to buy back in on this dip.
Just did exactly the same. Increased my number of shares by 3%
And I'm 1% up on new shares. Thank you trading 212 haha. Now to read up on capital gains taxes.
"I've got a big problem, holding 90 contracts of $21 call at avg .89 and I think there will be a pullback tomorrow. Gonna be down a lot of money."
Difference is institutions actually back NIO now. With JP Morgan weighing in heavy on the valuation I don‚Äôt think this will happen.
Wait what? It‚Äôs going to go downhill? The shirt is only 28%. I don‚Äôt think that will cause panic sell. Right?
"Down 4% in pre-market, but it means nothing. I guess big investors eat shorties today and tomorrow. Let's see."
"There will be a pull back, the shorts are counting on that after  the sharp rise. It's down to the hands and how many people set a loss limit.

From a long stand point, we should be OK if it doesn't break below 17.20. Another squeeze can happen if more fomo joins and the market continues to swell."
"i think a short-term pullback is inevitable, if not these coming few days or it will be later on, this is due to some people still thinking that Nio may be a shit company or a scam, given the recent rally, they're either taking profits or shorting it. But these short-term moves aren't going to affect Nio's long-term growth, there's still a lot of room for it to expand. I'm a long-term holder of Nio, planning to hold it for 3 years minimum"
when is due date?
I'm up about 300 dollars rn should I sell my shares before the price drops and then use that 300 to purchase more shares?
Friday
"Depends on your direction, you want to sit long (2-5 years) and make more return or day trade short term and then hold, or just maxmise profit in short term.

I'd suggest you look into shorting and/or calling with your shares. Learn more on that before attempting.

Selling and buying in again has its risk, if you're not careful at looking the gerneral market and it rides up too fast, you will be out of shares and waiting again.

Shorting and options call negates that part but have other inherit risk.

Good luck!"
you're fucked dude.
down today but could still be up tom... good luck!
Bought another share at 18.99. 5 shares now. Not much but it's something : )
Boys I have chopped my hands off and typing this with my nose so that I am not going to sell. We are in it together hit me up if you‚Äôll need a shoulder to cry on.
Already looking like a big pullback today. Good time to stock up
If anything little pullback tomorrow then fomo buy buy buy
Don't normally do this but the gains have been too good to sell now. I'm gonna hold for over a year to avoid short term cap gains tax. Will continue to add leaps on dips
guys I was hoping for a discount on some shares so if you guys could sell and take your profits to buy more shares at a lower oeice that would be great.
"[Dilution](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-announces-proposed-offering-75000000/) 

Just when I stock up on the ‚Äúdip‚Äù they decide to dilute. Don‚Äôt they have big boy Chinese investors?"
"i bought into $LI on the dip

any other Chinese EVs to consider?

my hypothesis is that people will buy all of them as a pseudo ‚ÄúETF‚Äù until a clear winner is decided.

and if there is a clear winner, second and third place are still going to have significant market share."
"Fuck, why did I sell"
"NIO announced share dilution with 75.000.000 new shares issued.
RIP"
And we are off!!!!
"Cash gang, nice dip tonight get to hopefully buy tomorrow for mad discount :) if it works all in, if its a moderate discount prolly half in"
Hoping to see another big day
"Selloff today, trading212 selling+a Lot of shorts, tell me how you feel about it"
How much will they dip today do you guys think? Made a small profit but thinking about selling and buying in later
Its holding steady... if we can stay above 19 by eod we should be good for another bump next week
"Will we have a Nio Day 2020 in December again? Any input would be appreciated, gracias!"
I accidentally did 3 sell calls at $17 8/28. I know im noobing it but did I just lose all my shares?
Looks like a jump to $20? Wtf happened
My little battery that could
Holding on to 10 1/15/2020 calls for a $20 strike. Should I continue to hold or sell?
XPEV selling off.
Any thoughts on NIO stock effects if Elon really does unveil an economically feasible million mile battery in September?
"Seems like the stock has dropped today, what do you guys think is a good entry point for buying new shares, I currently have like 200 shares at 15 $ per share, I was thinking about buying some more."
"No tears, I predict Q4 earning to be another good jump."
"BYD and XPENG, but those aren‚Äôt as promising as Nio due to nios plans to expand out of China soon and their Baas"
"I just got some Xpeng, I'm hoping to load up on that once it drops after this IPO surge."
Good thing you sold
"Judging by the TSLA move today, there is more short term upside for NIO I think."
"You're fine, we will buy back cheaper tomorrow or Monday."
"Why are they diluting the shares? Are the raising money to buy something like a factory?

Is this dilution something bad or good?"
I thought they said the bailout they received earlier in the year was enough for them to last the year. What‚Äôs the reason for dilution ?
May dip due to short sellers üòî
"Sucks as a t212 user, but im glad i read this post before the market opened- sold at open, thanks for the heads up! Im waiting for the xpev ipo and ill put the cash into that in an invest account."
Feels unfair
There is support just under $19 it seems.
Short term profit taking has finished.
And recovered quickly.
"imho, China won't be left behind technologically. If it is, not for long."
"not much considering that they are least in the EV race, more damage will be done to legacy auto manufacturers who were having already a lot of troubles trying to start to catch."
"With shares about to be diluted, either stay in for the long haul or sell and buy in at 12-13"
"ma boy i didn¬¥t chop my hands off....had a panik moment and sold my position just to re-enter 10 minutes lates. I know i know, just stupid.  


I promise to be a good Nio boy and just not touch my brokerage account until next year.   


All in in nio.  


I should chop of my hands, too."
BYD is Selling alot of buses in europe
"I think BYD has serious value. They are a large company that can easily adapt and expand. Right now all over the US I see people wearing BYD face masks, I understand that's a different division on BYD I believe, but still."
"This market buys everything, kinda crazy but what can you do."
"Yeah, I moved the investment to MSFT hoping the TikTok sale will go through"
"If there are more shares in circulation then they are not that rare anymore.

18.08 postmarked do you feel the panic yet?"
"There will be some tiny pushback today and tomorrow due to people taking profits on a Friday but Monday should see it continue it's bull run. My average is $12,  I'm not selling yet. It has the potential to go much higher in the long term."
ü§´ü§´ü§´ü§´ü§´
there is a sub for XPEV r/xpeng. More drop to come imo.
"yea, i felt the same about EVs in general as the Chinese smog situation is a great driver fo adoption.

I‚Äôm a bit more curious about what happens with BAAS. A million mile battery would eliminate it. maybe"
"Haha. Same here, you're not the only one"
MSFT is all together a different investment.
"I don't own any, just thought it is somehow relevant today."
"mods need to allow a celebration post... and if it crashes, they need a group support post!"
Let's fucking go!
Are you not entertained???!!!!
EZ
It will go up to 100 dollars soon
"Between the stock price and some good calls from before earnings, these last two days have been by far my best ever days as a trader/investor. Flew convincingly into 20 and triggered a mini sell off at 20.97, last week I was starting to lose hope it would go past 15 this month. To the moon NIO gang üöÄ"
Shout out to the longs from the $3's ü•Ç
idk how much more short term growth we can get but long term we'll be on the moon.
Apparently 100 million shares we shorted today. Was just reading a piece on it. Shorts up to no good want... let‚Äôs make their life miserable just like TSLA did.
Man I only got 49 stocks @ 13 I‚Äôm pretty bummed out... I just can‚Äôt afford to get as many as I want
Have a 10/16 call up 75%. Gonna hold a bit longer considering the August sales are releasing next week and the hype is building up. Feeling hella good
Newbie here
I said this a year ago but no one listened
Got a few 21c riding on next weeks sale numbers and feeling good after just now seeing $20
"Celebration is obviously a great and enjoyable part of success. However, when the sub begins getting flooded with too many, i do plan to keep them to a minimum so that more in depth and intellectual posts can be readily accessible to those investors who seek intellect over hype. Trying to keep it fair for every one! Certainly a week for celebration. Cheers!"
Gg
Your definition of soon requires more detail.
"Lost $1000 on earnings calls, went up $8000 in value on stocks and calls these last two days. This stock makes no sense but I‚Äôm happy now"
2.75
Hey man it'll keep going. Nio is the savior of man
"absolutely 

is there any appetite to invite discussions on NIO and it‚Äôs contrasts with Li Auto? it seems like there‚Äôs money to be made on both."
Next week
That‚Äôs hilarious those are pretty much exactly my numbers. Cheers fella! Enjoy the tendies üçó
Awesome retarded answer! Thx
Kill yourself
"Wow, you sure are retarded"
"I am an oracle and I forsee NIO passing 100$ Thursday, next week, at 11:37:22 eastern time, for the first time. Unfortunately for you I have seen my death. About 24 years, 4 months, 24 days, 6 hours, 22 minutes, and 12 seconds from now, I succumb to cirrhosis of the liver. My doctor warns me to lower my intake of red meats, added sugars, and alcohol abuse, but I disregard her warning. So, yeah, unfortunately you will have to deal with me for awhile."
Guess I deserve to be called retarded by multiple people for making a bad joke üòÇ
"Not comparable because of the huge difference in share price. 

The volume is bullish though"
What are your calls?
talk dirty to me
"You think xpeng or li will steal some investors. Li is probably trash,  but xpeng isn't."
God I wish they would come out with higher strike prices already. I'm tryna pick up some waaaaay OTM strikes for cheap. Classic lotto ticket set up that could actually hit on this one IMO. $30 strike is way too low for the highest availble.
I accidentally did 3 sell calls for $17 8/28. I know I'm noobing it but did I just lose all my shares if it doesn't dip down to that price?
Market is bullish on NIO and hence we will most likely see more growth in the future  is the point.
I don‚Äôt have any calls atm. I am holding stocks
3 sell calls $17 8/28. Still a noob so did I just lose all my shares?
Dirty
A white horse falls in the mud
"I'll probably toss money at Xpeng today and see where it goes, never done an IPO before but with the tech bull market (especially EV) I have confidence the stock will probably see some sort of increase in the first few weeks"
What strikes would you want ?
"Yup, sounds about right. You lose share but your overall gain would be ( $17-your cost basis/share)\*100+Premium your received."
This is the way.
I don't see any movement on RH as of now
"Probably $40, $60 for December expirations, and then some $80 leaps.

Certainly pretty extreme and gambley so I get why they aren't offered yet. Once they do get offered though I'll definitely get some money in on some dirt cheap far OTM contracts just in case the hype is real and it really does shoot off to close to $100 by EOY."
My shares average is 18.17.
I doubt it‚Äôs going over 50$ by EOY. That‚Äôs 150% gain in 4 months we are talking about. I will be glad if it is around 28-30$ by EOY.
You always sell calls at a strike price higher than your cost basis. In this case your loss shouldn‚Äôt be too much assuming you received a good premium for selling calls at a strike price lower than market price of the stock.
"I doubt it too. I'd only risk a small fraction of my overall portfolio on those kinds of strikes. I just think there's enough of a chance to make it worth putting a few bucks into chancing it anyway, given the potential returns if it actually does go full meme stock and gain that much like some have speculated."
"Okay that is very good advise, thank you sir."
When are the August numbers released?
Can't wait for the August delivery numbers to be released. Going to the moon baby!
What does over weight mean?
I got 80 shares at 14.65 and a call that's up 500.00 üöÄ
$20 fuckers!!!
Anyone expecting a pullback within the coming days and how low would you expect?
"Joined the gang with 35 shares today at $19.50, missed the dip but still happy with the purchase as I can see they have the potential to go gangbusters!"
Do you have the source these quotes are from?
Finally man!@!!!!
"usually within first 5 days of each month, but don't expect too much increase due to current production capacity constraint. Will see a noticeable increase for Sep though."
Usually a couple of days into the next month. I vaguely remember Li saying August would be down a little. Can‚Äôt remember if it was on the conference call ?
It means keep buying.
"Don't take advice from me but I'd say pullback is inevitable in the coming days ahead and no one knows when. What I'm sure about, is that Nio is a long play and timing the market is extremely difficult. My estimate is 30$+ in the end of the year!"
Just googled nio stock and it was in a bunch of articles.
"Yeah, I expected a pull back as it has done with every massive spike and this time it chose not to.

I cashed out to extract a bit of profit but now it's still going. I sold for 18.9 and although I believe in the future of the company and 20 is fine for long term I don't want to do what I always do and buy it right before its drops 10%a few hours or day later..."
"Stop taking profits. Just hold and enjoy. It's just like tsla when it went from $100 to $200. Take profits, you'll never regret taking profits. Lol yes you will."
"The OP is clearly Papa Musk trying to keep the NIO fans quiet. 

But he does have a point."
Daily discussion sucks. Please create new threads. It's more exciting that way.
Your intolerance is directly proportional to NIO‚Äôs growth.
"Not at all, it's just that as each time that it goes up, the flow of shitpost goes up too but nobody had actually posted the news behind the raise of this week for example.

I understand being hyped by making 20$ gain on the 5 stocks that you bought a week before but that doesn't deserve a post."
"I agree with you completely, and your point. 

By the way I‚Äôm in very deep with NIO so I‚Äôll see you around this sub!"
See you around!
Fucking beautiful
"What was your strike price originally?

I am thinking about buying NIO $27 12/22"
That is a very good LEAP. The guy who sold it to you must be kicking himself.
pm'd you
"this is a lesson to the bears at WSB who said Nio was a shit company, hope their shorts/puts are bleeding."
Thanks! Got in at the right time I guess.
"On Monday Aug 24 I bought a single LEAP NIO 12/16/2022 $20C
Today already at ~40% gain, bid price was $6.10"
I just bought $27 call expiring 12/16/2022 at $9.08
"Plenty plenty of time to see things pan out for them.
If all goes well their BaaS model should be either proven as an advantage against Tesla or an expensive flop. Also likely NIO will be in Europe or very close to be delivering in Europe.
On the other hand government support will be drying out by then and inefficient manufacturers will start to collapse like sprayed flies. 
Contrary to other industries I don't expect to see M&A happening here as different companies have very different manufacturing methods, so collapsing companies won't be bought out."
"Yeah, that‚Äôs what I was thinking. I think their BaaS model makes a lot of sense, and that it could work side by side with other companies models, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it will pan out. I like the LEAP here to see how European adoption goes. Big upside for not a lot at risk"
Correctus
"So the volume you guys are doing, requires a decent amount of extra money already it looks like?"
I don't understand your question.
"To purchase these contracts, or are they conditional until expiration and then you just pay whatever it is?"
"No no no. Plz study Options. Find the subreddit and you'll find tons of great info.
I had the same misunderstanding before."
"LEAP options (or LEAPs) are option contracts that expire at least one year from the date of purchase. The acronym LEAP stands for ‚ÄúLong-term Equity Anticipation.‚Äù LEAPs are more affordable than stocks because they're offered at option contract prices.

Source: Google"
"Awesome, thanks for the info."
"Awesome, thanks for the info."
Please go up to 22
It could be a bluff set by üêªs.
We broke it!
Where can I get that at? I mean to see these limits.
Smashed the damn wall!
Damn..... Sell or buy wall üêíüêíüêí
How does the 21 price target looks like?
Im hoping on 22 also.
"Level 2 Market Data. Right now Webull is giving 3 months for free, regularly you must pay through your broker."
"Sweet, thank you. So is Webull a preference over Robinhood?"
Robinhood has the same feature
"So they run the same, and people generally make fun of RH for the memes?"
Yep
Not sure why nobody posted about this news yesterday but here it is in case you're wondering why it jumped.
Lots of great stuff are ahead for Nio
My dumb ass sold at 14.50 looking for another dip ü§°
I believe the reason for the jump is the opening of the 150th NIO House in China.
"I did the same thing thinking i can profit off a dip. 

I re-entered at 15.15 and have been riding these gains. 

Not falling for the day trade trap. 

Holding nio long term where it cant bite you in the butt. Its not too late to enter back in. Sure it might go down a little until it stabilizes or it may keep going up. But long term I have a feeling it‚Äôll go up."
"I took some profit at 15.4 yesterday at opening. It was a limit order placed before open.

You can still re-enter and make profit if you plan to go long imo."
"Not at all, the market couldn't care less about the NIO Houses. üòÅ

A price target update, Trump threat, a global or major  event, earning report or delivery numbers is what's making the stock move."
"Nah, I'm definitely on the NIO train long-term."
Doh that must hurt.
"Yeah. I plan to reenter a little lower... 14 hopefully? I'm a long, just chose the wrong day to try and secure some extra gains along the way."
"It never hurts to make moneyü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Seriously! You created a new account to bypass the block. You have a serious problem, mate."
"It won't matter much when it's at 100$ if you entered at 14 or 19$, secured profit is always a gain so positive."
Tell that to people who sold tsla at $300. Pure pain.
"Facts. I think I got in around 12 originally, I believe. I think I'll force my myself to buy my shares back if it hits 20."
"If your plan is to hold long term, it doesn't matter necessarily if you buy now or next week."
Yes its closest tesla competitor they got government funded and soon become profitable it can become 100 easily as thr market is huge over next 5 years. Replacing gas üöó. Tesla wont sucess in china. No one understand nio better its china company
I would wait for the first pullback.
I bought some today in the 20's! Already up 5%! Let's go.
I just bought 50 shares at $19. I saw forecasts that the stock could end the year with a median of $95. But the estimates were from $7 to $125. Anything's possible. Don't forget that NIO probably has the Chinese government helping it.
"No offence but it wont hit triple digits by next year. I have 1000 at 2.33 avg. So at current price of $20, it already feels like $100 to me lol"
its not high ...100 bucks is high. hold long
Buy now. Buy on the pullback. Buy when it surges. Just keep buying.
"Just FYI, some of the CNN forecasts for Chinese stocks are messed up. The high mark of $125 could be Yuan instead of Dollars. That said, I think the stock is going places. But as far as I know no one industry-side is calling that sort of target yet. 
  
That said, judging by just the two upgrades we‚Äôve seen since yesterday morning, a lot of people have been sleeping on Nio. It‚Äôs bound to push upward as more sells turn to holds and holds turn to buys."
"understandable, I just look a tesla, and it‚Äôs crazy how much that stock has boom since march, I feel like anything is possible with EV. also if Nio can break into Europe and start producing sales there, it‚Äôs possible I think"
If you‚Äôre that confident (I am) by all means buy shares now and just hold
They are aiming there money will come on very soon. The chinese love to support nation cars
"You have to also keep in mind that the value of tesla is not just in their cars. They have an energy business, battery business, and are leading the industry in information that their cars are collecting for them"
Anyone waiting for a dip? Realistically
Still holding for the long run.
"$20?! üéâüéäüéâ

Now please stay there or higher..."
Hoping for a pull back today to buy some more
"I put in 600 in NIO at $3.80
And its now ~2800
Did not think it would go up this fast."
I'm an early adopter. Bought in at $14 three days ago. lol
"Aaanndd that‚Äôs it guys. Admitting loss here. Sold at 19 50%, just to see it keep going up. So buying back in again loosing a few shares. But more important learned a lesson: you can‚Äôt time the market, and if you invest in a company you believe long term, playing with it to get a few extra shares is not worth it. So even though I think it will have a dip, I rather be on the inside then outside. From now on, holding through the bad times ( easy for believers) but more important, holding through the extremely good times.
Wanted to share as I think it can help others."
NIO spoke for it's self today ...
Cant wait to see how baas will fair as an additional source of revenue in the coming months
We should see a pullback love the company tho
When are the August delivery numbers released?
WTF. Can't believe.
"My wine merchant was a happy man yesterday, I guess it my watch dealer's turn to be happy today."
While the trade talk resumes I think all Chinese stocks are good for now.
Cashing out all of my stock pre open and buying back in the dip. Will secure more shares for the same price and then I'm never letting go. NIO is so easy to read because so many people buying/selling are retail day traders.
When are they announcing September sales and do you guys think it will drop to 15 before it? I want to jump on the train :)
[deleted]
Should I hold 1/15/2020 call option $15 & $17? Or take the profit?
"Buy the dip at open, 5min rsi and stoch are through the roof in premarket."
Yo I mad I sold my calls lmao
"Too late to get in, or wait for post earnings dip? What‚Äôs is good price to get in at cause this looks to be taking off"
"As someone who‚Äôs been watching NIO for 2 weeks and waiting for a dip to buy in, when would y‚Äôall recommend doing that for the long and short term."
Kinda regretting cashing out my 39% gains at $17.41. Looks to be rocketing again today
"I'm so retarded that I sold lots of covered calls last Friday with a strike price of $16 that expires this Friday. What's the chance of me getting assigned before Friday? Should I roll up and out these options as soon as possible, or I just need to do that on Friday and I'm fine?"
"See a lot of people saying it will go down again to 15/16, why?"
Should I still try to buy more? I don't know when to get in anymore :(
"Slowly increasing my cost average, up to 25 shares at $16.80"
Has it peaked?
"I found out today about NIO on news related to the stock market and decided to do research to learn more about the company and its products.

The thing is all that is talked about on the internet is its performance on the stock market. It makes me sceptical of it being a good investment considering the stock performance gets more attention than the company itself. How do you guys see that?"
What do people think about NIO for the long run? Is it worth as a long term investment?
"Avg at 14.6, probs dip today, might lock in profit idk"
"Cashed 55% of what I had in NIO at 19$, guess a lot of TPs around 20 +\-0,5.... dip to 16-17,5 and getting back in. That‚Äôs my strategy (I‚Äôm a beginner though)"
I'm waiting for anything in 17
"Should have got out at open, bought the dip and then held. 

More shares for your money. More gains to be made."
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll pull back immediately, probably a sustained rally this week and a pullback after Sep 4/5th"
TP of $20 ? Doubt you‚Äôll see anything less than 19 at close
I think the same because yesterday was a very good uprise. Lets see and make Nio a great company !
"In about 2, maybe 3 years, your stack will be worth $30,000"
I got in at $11 after gs downgrade. $14 aint nothing bruv. I held and protected this baby when people were throws arrows and daggers at it left and right.
Me too lol. $14.42 on Mon
The fact that we are still on the early stage of the NIO story means you can refine your strategy and still make lots of money. GLTA.
"I‚Äôm in Nio for the long haul. Other stocks I feel confident about but less certain long term I will sometimes open a position to hold indefinitely, then when I buy on dips I‚Äôll set a certain number of shares aside to play with so I can try to have the best of both worlds.
  
Nio, though? I‚Äôm holding long. I‚Äôd rather not complicate matters for tax time by taking short gains here and there."
Still hoping it dips one more time because I want to buy more!
It should be in the first 5 days of September
"Sorry to be the one to tell you that it will not stop till around 30 to 35. The dip will then be to around 23-25.

Edit: over the next 1 to 2 weeks"
What is ‚Äúthe dip‚Äù people keep referring to? Sorry new and getting my bearings.
It's going higher over the rest of this week and possibly some of next week
"A lot can happen between now and next January: China US trade war again, Trump re-elected, market catching up with reality of global worldwide Depression, second lockdown wave everywhere and whatever new shit 2020 could decide to throw at us (like the three gorge Dam breaking and flooding most of the factories in China) for the down side. 

NIO is likely to keep going up otherwise considering the past few quarters and the support that they have on their rating otherwise and you strike value are already in the money so they should keep going up. 

You should do whatever you feel better doing. A profit banked is a profit that you're not losing. 

There is always a chance to do better or worst but you should make your decision yourself and not blindly follow whatever a stranger advised online."
You‚Äôre a bit late my friend
"what is going on with NIO? (rhetorical question)

 are we truly at the early end of the trend?"
$16 dollars or less. Any more than that and you'll get burned or bored waiting for it to get into anything resembling a profit margin. Could go as low as $13/$14 but I'm dangerously optimistic.
You'll be thankful when the casuals sell so aggressively that it falls to $16 or lower.
Because they sold too early.
Generally after a large rally there's a retrace
"""A lot of people""? I think you mean literally the one person salty for selling out too early because of his trading 'prowess"" lol and just getting aggro to a bunch of people on here, getting more and more defensive the more and more he is proven wrong... All his signals told him to sell before today's boost lmaoooo. The dude has no idea how institutions build their positions over time. Why do you think all the stock upgrades come out at the same time. It's because they're done buying for now lol and have lit a fire under the stock to get their gains. Nio will never go to 16 or below ever again. I predicted a few days ago we would blow past 20 like 20 ain't shit. Personally I am thinking  we will realistically land around 32 ish by the end next week  (used to think 25ish but looks like it wants to go higher), at which point Nio will possibly start consolidating again, for a few weeks or months, grinding between 32 and maybe 23 or 24 at the bottom of a range, till such time that it wants to break out again."
It's never wrong to pull a profit although I am still holding my full position and expecting $20-$21.
I did the same. I hope for the pullback now.
Samesies
[deleted]
that‚Äôs what I did yesterday expecting a dip after a record high of 17...
"Unless you know how to day trade, this is how you end up wit 0 in the bank. Time IN market beats timing the market."
Any significance to those dates?
Well this is already ageing badly
I wonder what the new low is? No less than $16 surely
$2 would have been nice. Hopefully we're at the bottom of the mountain anyhow. I'm just working on the assumption that if it achieves even part way to Tesla's (what I see as ludicrous) market cap there are good gains to come.
"Because of a 20% increase yesterday, people who bought NIO early (like me) will look to get out and get their money back after several tumultuous and unusually slow weeks.

More sellers than buyers at open, the price will drop off a cliff. You can then buy back more shares for your money and buckle back in."
Thank you! My options are ITM now but I think there is a potential for uptrend especially with the August delivery which will raise the price soon in early September. And also people are recognizing NIO now.
Please explain
"No but a flash drop is likely, look at Tesla opening this week as an example."
Think it dip that low after the deliveries?
$20 is still a worthy investment if you plan to hold for a few years
The pullback on this is going to be mental when it hits
I thought that too with my TSLA but look at it now.
"The general thought is people not long on a stock sell at 20% gains, so dropping to 17 (-15%) is not unreasonable from people cashing in from the $16/17 mark. But who knows -- stocks that break resistance tend to climb for a bit afterwards."
"Almost there, and than I will buy more :D"
"Held until open but really can't see it clearing $20. 

Not now anyway."
"I'm not day trading because I'm not a moron. I'm taking my profit and waiting for NIO to drop below the price I sold for.

If you're genuinely that confident that NIO will never drop below $18.05 then show me how strong your hands are and buy options."
Loads of Convertible notes going for $3ish and monthly figures
The cars also look bang tidy
"Interesting, thanks"
RemindMe! Next Friday at 4PM
"You got the delivery numbers for each month until January and Q3 results as well in the mean time, that's a lot of potential for the stock price to go up clearly.

But you have US politics and global depression/pandemic as a risk to consider too."
15th Jan was 8 months ago buddy
It's $19.33 right now.
Before. Will go up again after deliveries.
"You're not wrong. Bad call short term imo, I've seen NIO drop big enough before to not buy when the market's climbing."
Really messy. Here we go!!!!
"If Nio follows Tesla patterns, we can't predict anything anymore as it's behaving kind of illogically"
Well well well...
"Aged like milk, only way faster"
How the turn tables
"https://imgur.com/OZCrIFJ

Bought that yesterday. I'd buy more if I wasn't already maxed out on all my positions. As my margin grows, so do my positions. I also don't understand options 100% and rather not ""show my confidence"" in buying something that has parts of the puzzle I just don't get. I don't even get how I make money, I just gambled some cash in this option for shits and giggles."
"I‚Äôm pretty new to investing what is to expect when these notes convert? Usually a drop I assume but how deep does it go I mean everyone reading Nios IR knows that this will happen and is it usually a hard recovery or downtrend after this happening?

I read a few weeks about this date and being careful. Now that nio is at a decent high for me (want to keep long) I‚Äôm torn if I should sell before the 4/5th or just hold through"
"$14 will sound unbelievable in a year. Got in for the first time at $6, doubled down at $9. Bought some at $14. Avg price was $11. Got out at open because I know a fall is inevitable but will buy back in with everything I have if it hits sub $16 again."

"You are right, there are many factors to consider üò•"
I meant 2021 sorry
We are still in premarket and it already crashed once 50min ago from 19.08 to 18.26.
Nio has never followed the pattern you've just described
All the logic you need in this market is cash is trash and the market is swimming in it.
"If you haven't cashed yet, enjoy your L."
"Aged well. Didn't stay at $20 for long, did it?"
"I'll be back to this post when it hits $16 in the next week, newfag. All of you are essentially paraphrasing ""sTonKs oNlY gO uP"" and acting like you have a clue. 

Show me your portfolio, show me what your ROI percentage.

Or would you rather just talk shit?"
"In this market it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess, but if the info is 100% legit and still valid, then it should have some impact, but not huge. In retrospect, I don‚Äôt think the last round of them really affected the stock price significantly, sentiment was the issue.

If you‚Äôre new: Don‚Äôt think of your investments as something to dump the second they go down. Make sure you have your goals set for a stock, based on good analysis, trust your gut, and diamonds hands all the way to your goal. Selling because of a slight dip due to profit-taking is the best way to miss out on a rocket ride. Nio has growth written all over it."
I've got a fair bit tied up in FTSE 100 stocks that are waiting to rebound unfortunately. But pretty much any NIO dips I will buy up if I can.
What is your price expectancy in a year?
 take the profits and go treat ur wifes boyfriend to some icecream
Hold.
"Yeah sorry, didn't mean to comment under your comment. I'm slightly high"
"OK so you're under the impression that a solid delivery number won't increase the stock price? I've heard of some wack takes on Reddit in my time but bro, come on.

Previous ATH was $15.24 - yesterday it shattered it comfortably.

Value of stock boosted from $1 to $16 and you think it'll just continously climb to $30 BEFORE the August delivery numbers? Nothing's impossible but having followed NIO from early doors (and made a fair wad along the way) I'm quietly confident with my strategy. 

Elaborate on yours if you want, I'm all ears."
I'm honestly hesitant
Are you a time traveler but perhaps not in our reality?
Come again? Hit $20 again. It's very volatile so I don't get what you are trying to prove. Big fluctuations are the norm.
"You made a call and pulled some profits, so why the aggro? I am holding a large position but I would never show it to you. I suggest you take a chill pill and not disturb our peaceful discussions."
"Watch out, we got a badass over here"
"Damn I really hit a nerve, didn't I?"
$100 would leave us at 1/4 of Tesla's current market cap. Tesla is ludicrously over priced but if the EV hype continues and NIO push home the home advantage in China then who knows.
Yes sir.
Lucky you! üòè
"You will be forced to buy in at a higher price - lol and we are already higher. Question is, how long until you realise you sold too early - even just for trade purposes? Do you buy back in now for a minor loss of share count or experience a much worse loss in a few days or few weeks."
"Epicly edgy, my guy.

No, I just know after soaring way above market value and thrashing an all time high, many will cash out and it will drop significantly lower than it is now. If you knew markets, you'd see trends. It's whatever - just trying to give the best advice I can to people. 

Set a reminder for a week or two and we can talk reality. When NIO is $16 again üò∂üëçüèª"
"I'm sitting out until $16. Would be tempted at $17. 

My point was about stability at over $20. Forget if it was this thread or another where I said ""if you haven't cashed out now  awaiting the dip, hold your L""

You're right about the fluctuations."
"Can only dream of being as much of a badass as you, twitchtrollkekw."
You'd rather just talk shit then. Got it! üòÑ
All we need are a few bits of good press and its game over. Anything tied to the government helping to expand NIO and this will 50% from whatever price it's at. Trump has a small change of heart with China and that will boom it higher.
"It went from $15 to $11 in a week after hitting a new ATH.

Let's wait a few day and see how messy it gets. I won't buy in at a higher price - if you genuinely believe NIO will continously rise indefinitely and never hit $16 a share again you are either part of the CCP and manipulating Chinese currency or delusional. Both as bad as each other. It has legs long term but will certainly drop off aggressively from where it is now. 

Remember Goldman switched it to a sell and it sent NIO into free fall? You don't think they'll try the same shit again, lol.

Hold yours. I've sold mine. I'll come back to this thread when it hits $16 üòâ"
"As long as you remain civil you can post whatever opinion you like but telling others to enjoy their L is not very nice, especially you said you can't see it clearing $20."
"I mean I just commented that it aged like milk (the fact that it wont cross 20 dollars, which it did), what are you even going on about man. Why are you so triggered."
RemindMe! 1 week
"Because it will drop dude and I hate seeing loss porn all over my timeline. It wasn't as snide as people are interpreting, I'm just saying if you haven't cashed now then you can't be surprised when you lose out $4-$7 per share in the next fortnight. I think NIO is a good prospect long term, but would rather sell highs and buy the dip, so when the glory days arrive, I've got as many shares as is humanly possible within my budget.

Sorry if I came off snarky.

Happy trading and best of luck with NIO."
He just lost out on a shit ton of gains after bragging then being wrong. Sucks to suck
"It's gonna be great to watch all of our portfolios continue to moon while you watch from sidelines on your high horse.

Good on you for taking profits but acting like you know what will happen just makes you look annoyingly cocky"
Good luck to you too.
"Just a hunch. I've made a lot of money already, I'm speculating the direction I think the market will move and the best way to secure the biggest bag possible. 

This advice is free. You don't have to take it, just explaining my entry and exit strategy to secure as many shares and therefore, as much profit as possible.

Best of luck to ya ‚ú®"

Im only 21 and I bought at the 3 to 5 dollar mark. Got the parents to put in a bit. I had 1300 shares. I sold at 16.2 and bought back in at 14.5. I Now sold at 16 1/2 my position. I have 400 shares left and made 20k plus. WTF I made more then all my friends make working in year. Pass me a beer
"$NIO $TSLA New energy and holographic $WIMI markets are huge, needs in future are very certain, we should keep long-term investment primarily."

How do you guys think NIO will perform during elections? Thinking of buying more now or waiting for a dip later on
Is $20 possible by 9/11 ?
"I‚Äôve been holding out on buying more since this morning, I‚Äôve got another 100 (dollars) on hold, but it keeps going up. WTH NIO?"

"There‚Äôs been a lot of good news coming in over the past week or two between new details on BaaS, Mobileye, etc. Today specifically there have been some positive moves in US-China trade talks and UBS upgraded Nio from sell to hold. That at least contributes to the rise today. Still, this is a very big rise."

Your friends only make 20k a year? What do they do?
"Take profits if/when it hits $20 this week, wait for a dip, then buy back in with 2021 calls."
I think so. By end of September for sure
Hurry and buy before it goes up even more.

I got in at about 11$ too!  But I sure wish I got in at around the 3 $ mark. Atleast it's something as you say
"Thinking about it too, bud. I think I might grab some more on the potential pullback that might occur"
"No one is ‚Äòpredicting‚Äô $100. There are no analysts with price targets in that range... 

I‚Äôm worried that the US might escalate its trade war against China which could effect these ADR‚Äôs. 

Also there is going to be extreme competition in the sector with focused companies like Tesla, Lucid, Polestar, Li, BYD etc. Plus all the traditional car manufacturers who will likely wake up next year and dedicate more resources into EV‚Äôs. 

All that considered... I‚Äôm balls deep in Nio with stop losses in place and plans to buy more once the price stabilizes again lol."

Giving you permission to get the 5 piece and upgrade to zucchini fries
You can buy a house with downpayment of 20k? Property tax costs more than that here.
awesome pal!
Definitely a short squeeze going on after all the factors you said spooked them.
"I see, I wonder if this rise is only temporary or if the stock will go down in the next couple weeks."
"I recommend you to only buy jan 2021 or 2022 option as NIO is very volatile. To get 5X 10X gain on option you will have to be lucky as well as buy OTM option that expires weekly in red days. That is huge gamble and most of the time, these options expire worthless."
Yup. I have about 60 contracts total spread out that expire on the 28th and September 11. I‚Äôve sold enough to cover the purchase so I‚Äôm free roling. I may capture some profits at the end of the trading day.
I Solemnly swear that I will use the money for the best of intentions. I‚Äôm going to steal my wife back from her boyfriend and maybe even take her to dinner.
"I only have 15 of the 17.5 8/28 expiration now because I sold 5 to cover my baseline. I have 51 total calls for NIO in all. Spread between $17.5, $18, and $19 with expirations on the 28th, Sept 11th, and Sept 18th. Going to be an interesting few days. Wish I had 100 but I‚Äôll settle for what I have. 
(Edit: position numbers)"
Only $100 in 3-5 years? Nikola reached $80 without producing anything. I do not get this if I'm being honest.
I‚Äôm a New Yorker. I like that. Bawls. Lmao
thx!

They‚Äôre ‚Äúkids‚Äù
Tendie is a meme. It's like champaign for investors/traders I guess
Pretty sure it means chicken nuggets?
Thnks
"To be honest, I bought 200 shares at $7 and sold them when it was $11, because I thought this would be just the next pump and dump. But then I saw that NIO is for real and bought again: 200 at $11.
Completely irrational.
But for the long-run it doesn‚Äôt matter."
I think I'm just gonna go with the 5 piece... slow down man...
"Where do you live Jesus seek better parts of America

"Mind making a write up and posting it here? I've been trying to learn and I get some good ground but get a bit lost on theta, etc... So for example, right now I just bought some calls that expire 2021. But even if the price hits that #, I'm told I can still walk away with no cash because of theta.. That I don't understand."

This is the way

Yeah it wont take that long at all
What happened to Nikola? Why did it plummet for $80?
I knooowww righhttt
yup. there all students
We‚Äôll split the zucchini fries when it hits $20
Sorry I like to earn money. Properties here climb 100k per year. Does yours even climb $100 per year?
Its better selling put spreads or covered puts. Way less risk and you get paid an option premium. I sold 16 doar put spreads for nov and Oct and they're already in the money. My broker credited me around 250usd for this trade. Do a lot of high probability trades and it's a nice side hustle. Wont turn ur 5k to 150m but I'll pay your gas or Bill's etc
There are wonderful youtube videos on option trading. It would be easier that way. you can also download options profit calculator and check how much your options contract will make/loose money for your short/long position.
Too lazy to learn yourself lmao smh
Fo sho
Be careful. My wife‚Äôs BF has been known to kill for less. Don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you.
We'll think about it okay... thats a big step
I have ZERO idea how to do any of that or how to even get started .
When it hits $23 we are definitely splitting zucchini fries
"Options Alpha.com. watch all their courses and read comments and ask questions if ur confused.
The tldr of the entire site is that selling options is a high probability game. So done a lot of times around a longer time span the potential for.profit is more compared to buying calls."
I'll admit it... I'm ready. I'm ready to order zucchini fried there I freaking said it out loud its out there
Hahahahaha they are issuing more stock so we are going to see a temporary dip.
"No, 40%+

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nio/institutional-holdings"
Baillie Gifford make up 10%. Great funds for UK investors.
"The number I heard somewhere is 80%, pretty close."
You guys never regret holding once reach 100 to 150 dollars. They are going international that is profit
"Cheers, I'll take a look at that data later"
"

I'm considering moving my Vanguard Lifestrategy fund to SMT. I like their holdings."
"I switched a third of my trackers across a year ago, then the rest a couple of months ago. Higher risk, but I'm relatively young so happy to take the risk over a long term horizon. Accumulating NIO for the same reason."
One thing to be aware of is that SMT is a huge fund so holdings can look really small. E.g. nio is 1% or so. Hence I bought some on top. Great fund though and cheap fees for active fund.
"I agree, will definitely look into doing it."
buy back smarter kids
"I sold my wife for shares just kidding I don't have a wife

Because I sold her"
"Do it again, let‚Äôs shoot for $20 lol"
$20 coming soon. People are FOMOing
Wait you sold your kids?
18 buddy
I sold my soul to afford this stock
"Yes bro!!! Money comes first 
Romans 19: 1-4"
I wish i have more shares.
"I was FOMOing Monday, or at least thought I was, buying additional shares at $14.60 midday and then wondering if I was going to regret it short term. Then this morning happened and I was wondering if I should do what I‚Äôve done a couple times and sell at a profit before buying back in at a discount. But I held and actually bought a few more shares in the low $16 range, again wondering if I might regret it. If anything, I wish I had bought a few more shares this morning! I‚Äôm still not convinced we won‚Äôt see a dip, but I‚Äôm not going to trade out of my position and then watch the stock continue to rocket without me. Besides, as with many (if not most) here, I have a good long term view of Nio."
It was the only way to put money in this Chinese car brand
That's not a stock analysis and should get a ban.
"NIO to the moon is long overdue. It's only because of bullshit trade war and racism that this stock price was so heavily manipulated and kept down. Had this been an american company, we would already be 50B market cap by now."
Let's hope it hits $20 by Friday Market close to draw in some new investors
Fuck it hit 17.
What happened to the sellers after the earnings report who said they'd buy back in lower? Will they have to fomo back in now?

Anyone know why it gapped up?
"My speculation is that 1, there must have been some good news or talks happen and 2, that after they're Q2 and Mondays trading hours being better than last week more people are getting in on it"

Let‚Äôs hope! ü§û
That‚Äôs zero analysis. Thanks for wasting my time lol

Sorry viewer discretion! im not a financial advisor! Just giving an opinion on how I follow my investments
Also 8-10x im usually right on my observations and speculations buddy and im not telling anyone to do anything with their money just pointing out that today were going big
"Agreed! to many restrictions placed on China but hey hoe! We are now seeing nio cars in America, the ball is rolling"
what type of stock price are you expecting within the next three months?
And pushed through convincingly. If it closes above $17 I'll have the best sleep of my life tonight
"fuck it, 20 EOD?"
Tbh I have no idea as I pay no attention to the sellers im going for the moon with 60 shares avg price 3.33ps holding for the long run my friend
UBS upgrade and reports on earlier expansion to Europe than expected (2nd half of 2021)
Sure looks like it üëèüëç

"Nothing massive. Personally I reckon it will be $24-30 in a couple months then after New year and more post covid shenanigans i.e news lockdowns second wave. Then we will all be able to assess how we go about our investments future goals n so fourth everything needs time in life.

But i myself don't see nio going past $35 or more this year"
I bought a few hundred shares last time it was 10 and have been selling weekly covered calls up till now. My strike this week is $17. I may buy it back for a loss on the option trade and sell a higher strike to help offset the loss. Wanna keep my shares.
Same here I hope it closes $19 final on Friday with a few ups and down the rest of the week
"ü§£ one can only dream, 18.17 is my final opinion"

I hope that im completely wrong as I know very little tbfüòÇ so touch wood I can look back at this on new year and laugh when its past $70.
Stop trying to reduce your risk. You are reducing your gain. Just buy and hold.
Ahhhh! üòÇ

Well it hit $18 mate. You were wrong.. üòÇ
Dude this is me lol. I did this and not ashamed.

Are you on stock twits? Its lots of fun.

"Sorry guys, but after hours trading doesn't really mean shit and nothing to get too excited about."
Great meme ! Breaking Even to me is profit. Let‚Äôs get to 15.50 range today boys and girls!!

"I'm glad NIO is finally getting valued higher. My major concern right now is a lot of people bought in at $4/5, the temptation to take profit for these people plus all the previous $15 bagholders could tip the scales back.

Will it come back down today or continue on? I'm looking to buy more shares hmm
I regret selling at open so bad
Bought some calls yesterday right at close. Up 60%. Lets keep this up.

Shit son. At what point do i buy more
Who‚Äôs happy and you know it clap your hands! üëèüèª
"Market close... And so it begins, pullback or a second push"
"**lights cigar**

üòé"
My wine merchant is a very happy man today.
I have reached my target of $15 and have pulled the chute on NIO. Good luck to all.
"Wow almost $16 already, to the moon we go! Hold on tight!"
16$ today . Has to be
US and China are playing nice in trade talks. https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/business-53900054.
Bought back in. Hopefully 19 EOW and I am out.
"Is it just me thinking that with the flood hitting Chang Jiang, August delivery number is going to be less than expectation?"
Fuck I want to sell so bad and buy pullback tmrw
I have a $25c for 10/16 that has doubled. Should I keep it or hold?
Anyone selling short positions before close? Or holding
Today was a good day ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"In the next 1 to 2 weeks, NIO will spike to $28, and then quickly retrace to about $21."
Premarket looking good! Up or down. Lego nio!
Just buy more if it dips back
I'm like a week away from getting 10k to invest and I'm so mad I didn't get in earlier lol. Hopefully I can time the pullback good and buy some more
Plus dollar is weak af.
Same. So exciting!
16.50 pew pew
$17 today looks likely.
ATH? can you define this
Opened at $15.09  - and ascending triangle looks strong.
"It seems most of the Chinese stocks are up right now, what nobody has mentioned is that the Dollar/Yuan index is dropping like hell."
"is it wise to sell and then reinvest? im new to stocks, so with this sudden aggressive rise, will it come back down?"
same I wanna buy a few ... hope it drops to atleast 13 man cmon
if you made a profit dont regret it.
Lesson to be learned - never sell/buy at open.
"Yeah stock markets just gonna do it's thing. Like, that would've been a great idea if you looked at like the past 3 days or something, but of course things just do whatever."
"Feel your pain, I sold at 14.95 last night, as im wanted to sell my shares on freetrade and buy them back on trading212. Was going to buy them back today but fucking typical it shoots up."
Sold for 100% profit after 1 day. Will buy after a dip.
$2000 by year end.
"$50 Q2 2021, 100 Q2 2022, $500 2025"
Clap Clap!!!
"He‚Äôs happy today, sure, but in ten years will he be happy when you‚Äôre sipping wine produced at your own personal vineyard paid for by NIO gains? 
  
/s"
"Peace
$17 now"
Taking profits if you bought in early is probably never a wrong choice.
"Well done, perhaps it is a good time to open your most expensive bottle right now."
"If you bought at something like $5 and sold it all at $15, then that's the wisest choice you can make. 

Whole lot of people in here telling everyone it's going to be, like, a bAjIlLiON dOlLaRs next week lol"
Wow
"I‚Äôve seen this brought up a few times, so you‚Äôre not alone. If that‚Äôs accurate and the stock takes a hit, I‚Äôm buying the dip."
"Literally the same, think I'll Yolo and sell though"
"I am waiting till August delivery numbers, probably."
Hoder
And what is your reasoning behind this?
what is the dip though
Lucky number $17.77 @ 12:45pm PST
$17.15 and rising
All Time High
"If you're looking to day trade and flip stocks with options or wherever then you're on your own. 

If you're looking to buy in and then hopefully sell at some higher value, then buying ASAP is the way to go. Maybe it'll dip, maybe it won't. No one can say for sure.

The idea there is that you believe that price will trend upwards over some arbitrary timespan, so you buy in and hold until that time. Daily minor fluctuations that might happen tomorrow all wash out.

I bought in at an average around $3.50. Now that it's $17, that one time it dropped 20% in one day doesn't really matter anymore, right?

And just to reiterate, you can get lucky timing the market and sell at $17 and then buy again at $15, but at that point you're trying to guess what the market is going to do and there's thousands of people who infinitely smarter with ungodly resources who still can't get it right, so keep that in mind. That and you'll get hit with short term capital gains each time which may negate any earnings you made."
I think 13 may be a thing of the past now
Fuck man we lost out chance
Yes that is very true. I'll wait patiently for a point where i can rebuy back in. Because i know if i buy right now it will drop
But what if they had bought at open today? Would have profited
F
"Out of interest, may I ask why you wanted to switch your shares to trading212? My shares are in freetrade at the moment and couldn't think of a reason to switch... What's your thoughts? thanks."
UK investor? I'm on trading 212. Better than free trade?
You would‚Äôve cleaned up today I reckon
Yeeet! One can only hope
"Hey, one can only dream!"
"I will be able to retire as soon as that happens, but travelling the world will not be possible for some time. Guess I will be playing Microsoft Flight Sim instead lol."
I will send you a case of my best for sure if it happens.
"Yeah that seems a little optimistic,  that but I would say about 2 million next week seems about right pew pew  üöÄüöÄ"
Me too. I'm super long Nio. I'll be buying whatever the dip is.
But I‚Äôm not sure if it will ever go lower than this
Maybe with August delivery number
Massive ascending triangle forming.  Last time this formation occurred the stock went from $6.80 to $16.40 in 2 weeks
Not today.
A dip is a slang in stocks when the stocks decrease on the graph
18.10 woohoo
$18
This is a well educated post.
"Oh ok, thank you so much for the advice."
fuck me
"Just jump in now, it's going A LOT HIGHER"
It's not really like you lost out man. I'm sure people have said the same thing about thousands of stocks in the past. Just buy at a point you think the share is actually worth and hold it from there. There's definitely more good news to come with NIO.
"Yep. Hell, I even slept in today and saw the stock soaring at 10. Bought some additional shares in the low $16 range and wondered if I would have been better off holding off for a dip. At end of day, I‚Äôm glad I got in for more when I did.
  
Might it dip below $16 again? It‚Äôs possible. But I have a long term strategy with this investment, so I pulled the trigger and, at least for right now, I‚Äôm happy I did. 
  
Point is, I agree that in many cases buying/selling at open can be a bad idea, but sometimes you take you have to take your chances."
"Will take this as a lesson learnt, only got into stocks the last couple months. Was up about 26% when I sold but think I will reinvest during the next dip."
"Started off with Freetrade but then was hearing good things about trading212, as I am new I thought I would check it out. Trading212 has a lot more companies to invest in, aswell gives a lot more details about the company such as dividend yield and background of the company. 

Another reason was Trading212 had no limit on google pay topups, which makes it very easy to topup when you are out and about.

Also I had an issue one time with the freetrade app which white screened when I tried to buy and sell stocks, which I had to fix by reinstalling the app. Couldnt see anyone else having issues with this after googling it but it just put me off."
"Yes UK, IMO I think 212 is better."
"Yeah. :/

I ended buying back in. Still up so that‚Äôs good"
"Yup! I never thought I was a flight sim guy but I just ordered a flight stick. Hopefully I'll get one in the next month, should've invested in Logitech."
"That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm holding. I don‚Äôt know if it will go lower but I‚Äôm convinced it will go higher, whether immediately or over the next few weeks/months. So I‚Äôll go with my gut and hold. If the stock pulls back I‚Äôll buy additional shares on dips."
"You know that there are more factors in the stock market than patterns, right?"
18.57 weehoo
If it goes to 18 I just might
I'm too pussy to jump in big. I only threw in a 100 bucks. Should i go more for the long run or should i wait for a slight dip
"There‚Äôs also a lot of potential from things they have in the works that isn‚Äôt even baked into the price yet. Look no further than BaaS and Mobileye for some examples. These things could generate revenue and separate Nio from the pack. There‚Äôs plenty of room for EVs. Not every company will make it, but Nio has some key building blocks in place and if all goes according to plan will be a massive name in the not so distant future."
"Rumour has it that should be after earnings around 5th sept, although if this rally continues, you‚Äôd probably be better off just buying now anyways"
"I am actually waiting for the new Nvidia RTX 3090 and Ryzen 9 4900X to build my new rig, my current laptop can only play medium setting. And I have shares in both companies."
Remindme! 2 weeks
"If you are buying to hold for a long time, the entry point doesn't really matter imo (yet)."
"You can buy around 6 shares right now. In a week or two, you'll only be able to afford 4."
Bought 80‚Ç¨ it is now 100‚Ç¨ as a broke college student
"My existing 5700xt and Ryzen 7 3700x surprised me with 4K at good setting, or whatever is below ultra. I think I'm going to need to lower some settings and play at 1440p because my frame rate definitely hurts at times, but I don't really expect a 5700xt to be able to play in 4k."
"Ok if you want toüòÇüòÇ
Funny thing is, if I am wrong, I still win since I also hold NIO.
It's not that I think NIO is a bad company, like many..but most ppl are simply too bullish on it."

It matters if you're a broke college kid like me :')
I'm of this school of thought. Difficult/impossible to time the market. Just buy in if you're confident long term. If you have spare cash during a dip even better.
goddamn straight up fax guess i'll go in on it more rn
"I am playing on a TUF A15 4800H 1660ti laptop with a 1440p display, I am also playing with the setting below ultra but frame rates are just ok. I made a fair bit of money from AMD since last summer and I am dying to build my dream rig. Judging by the leaks of the RTX 3090 I will need a big case probably Lian Li 011XL."
"I've been trading for about 12 years. Real factors are what what drive stock prices, you are not wrong there. But there are often  periods where not much actually happens. That's where you see patterns emerge, most of which is algorithmic in nature or the amalgamation of human emotion distilled into a pattern. NIO has been making higher lows for around 2 months in a massive ascending triangle formation during a consolidation period. There's a lot of good news that recently came out and the stock didn't really react. Now it looks we might be breaking out of the triangle. This is usually followed by a huge shift upwards and then a long consolidation period again."
"Yeah, leaks have the 3090 as being an absolute giant beast. It seems like my biggest limiting factor is GPU, it seems like ram utilization is about 18GB, so I don't think theirs any significant need for 64 gb. While I'm rocking an all AMD build, I've never owned any AMD stock."
"That's interesting. Thanks for educating me. I am a fairly new investor at 18 years old, so I am always grateful for explanations :)"
"But with Ryzen 3000 the memory latency is a little problem, I am hoping I can OC my ram to 4000MHz plus with Ryzen 4000. I will be buying the RTX 3090FE on day one cos I think the supply will be limited. The wait for Ryzen 4000 then will be a bitch tho."
Thanks for keeping it short champ
I agree and very concise

I don‚Äôt know what this says but I‚Äôm positive it‚Äôs great DD
I scrolled all the way down to china
I‚Äôm at 31 call contracts at $10 Jan 2022.
Is it fucked up I trust reddit so little I think this post is just short sellers looking for info... man I'm just paranoid right... ha.. ha..
$15c 9/18 and $14c 11/20
Im gonna put in some long call options in a few weeks.
"80 @ Jan 2021 $20
60 @ Jan 2021 $20
20 @ Jan 2021 $15
10@ Jan 2022 $10
8 @ Jan 2022 $12"
2x $11C jan 2021
LEAP: $20C Dec/16/2022 I want to be ITM by year end.
$20c exp 12/16/22. I see it in the $50 - $65 range by then!
9/18 13c‚Äôs and 1/2021 13c‚Äôs. Finally coming back to life after today. Want to just go all in leaps because it will definitely get there. And premiums aren‚Äôt too crazy.
I sell weekly covered calls @ 17.00 strike.
"5 calls $12c exp 11/20

4 calls $11c exp 1/21/21

2 calls $5.5 exp 1/21/22"
"A couple of contracts $17 strike, Jan 17 2021. Ugh. Not looking promising."
Big dick boy. What are each of those contracts currently worth?
"Sorry I‚Äôm newish, what does that mean?"
"HA no, you can find it pretty easily on any ticker site. Like here [http://www.maximum-pain.com/options/nio](http://www.maximum-pain.com/options/nio)"
I sell weekly covered calls @ current price\*1.15
 it's probably going to be 17 this week. Are you happy capping your gains at 17? Would have thought 20 may be safer. I see an ascending triangle forming. Looks like NIO wants to go blow past 20 and hit somewhere around 25 in the next 1 or 2 weeks
You don't think NIO will hit $17 by 1/17/2021?
Looks like they are currently going at ~$8.50
"He probably said that because of the volume I bought.  A contract means that I am agreeing to purchase 100  shares of the stock (NIO in this case) at a certain price at a future date. So my contracts are to purchase 3.1K NIO stocks at $10 in Jan 2022. There is a bit more too it, but that‚Äôs a brief explanation."
Shows you how much I know
"That puts you very OTM, where the premiums are shit. What‚Äôs the strategy?"
"Well, last time it hit 16 it goes back down to 11. So I do expect it to go to 20 soon, but i guess a lot of people will be selling, and the price will go down to 15-18 at some point"
I won‚Äôt let my options get exercised. I‚Äôll buy back the contracts and take a cut in next weeks premiums to recoup.
"Well, obviously I thought it would when I bought it. But with my luck, not convinced. You play with the bull, you get the bear."
And how much did you pay initially?
Uhhh it‚Äôs 100 shares buddy
"It‚Äôs usually lower than 17, until today, right?"
Oh boy this did not age well at all. Hope you got out?
"HOLY SH*T. Literally the day I after post this, it goes to $17. I need to complain often and loudly."
"Just under $9 so I‚Äôm a bit under, let‚Äôs hope for an up 16 months."
"Yep, edited. Thinking too big."
Right
So sad....
"It‚Äôs over 19 today guys, congrats."
"how are you doing today? I sold $16 covered calls for this Friday, and feel so sad today.... Did you roll out/up your covered calls this week?"
I‚Äôm sad. Hoping for a sell off after hours. It‚Äôll cost me over 2000.00us to buy back my options as of today. I‚Äôll wait for theta to reduce the price of the option and see where we are at Friday before market close. I might be fucked. I might get lucky.
"same, it costs me probably $6000 now, Nio has been green for 3 days, so I would hope it'll be red later this week... hopefully...."
Stop selling people lol
Maybe 16 this week? Lol good luck my nio family!!!!
Seriously exciting time to be a Nio Long.
Good end to the day. Hoping it doesn't tank first thing tomorrow
Jesus what just happened?
GS put Li auto at a price target of $20 and NIO at $7. What bs is this? Can somebody tell me how this makes any sense other than blatant manipulation?
Maybe 15 EOD?
Why the 6% increase today ?
What are your thoughts if Tesla introduces the million mile battery as speculated ?  Would the BaaS be already extinct ?  Could this harm NIO‚Äôs sales ?
I'm slowly shifting some of my holdings to NIO. I love the look of the cars. Think battery swap will work well in China. My main worry is that it's Chinese. But also this is a strong strength given the support of the government.
When are we to expect August delivery numbers?
Its 15 now!!
Anyone else seeing a huge ascending triangle forming?
good prediction ;)
"I think NIO will establish support above $15 this week, but the all time high of $16.44 will stay intact until the first batch of Germany sales numbers are published."
It will
"Yeah I agree. NIO is a far superior company to Li. Li is way smaller with no global expansion plans, no charging/battery swap infrastructure, no pure EV, etc. While I'm invested in both companies, I believe NIO is the better company. Xpeng will be way more of a competitor than Li."
Well it got very close
Probably not. If anything I'm expecting a market selloff from last week.
"Nothing happened. That's why the stock went up. If NIO stock has good news, it will drop."
Tesla was also strongly supported by the US government in its early years.
After august
Most likely September 3-4
"Latest would be september 7th,"
Why do you think this? We just spent the past few days trying to break $14.50 resistance and we did it today. $14.50 dip is possible but I think we‚Äôre moving up overall
Obviously....
"Stop speculation of the XPENG IPO date and simply check the NASDAQ IPO Center or the NYSE IPO Center:

"Any credibility to that Monday rumor? I know you say it's unreliable, but all my sources say the 27th."
Goes public on the 27th according to my app.
will this be available immediately on Robinhood tomorrow?
[deleted]
Yes but at what time? And why all the secret on this info.
Your sources will be more accurate than mine.
That post can be deleted then.
what app do you use for that info?
"Only those, whose brokers support the IPO, get access to the shares at IPO prices. Others will have to fight after the shares are available on the market, i.e. you'll only end up buying at the top.

\---

LI (Li Auto), the another China EV company, IPO end of July. Time of IPO is around 11:30am, and it opens at $15.50, $4 higher than the actual IPO price. Bid price spiked up to 17 within minutes... AKA too high."
"Simply looking at what they produce, Xpeng does have a longer range. But I don't think that's anything special. Personally, I like Nio's battery changing solution. Though, it is a subscription model, I think it's interesting."
Very informative!  XPEV started trading at $23 today. It is way overpriced IMO.
"Usually it's later in the day like 12 noon or 1pm Eastern Time.
Simply because during the AM, the company management is being interviewed by the press, the NYSE will arrange for them to ring the Opening Bell, but in my opinion and in practice is to give the fucking brokers and traders time to line up all of us like retarded pigeons, they already have us lined up ready to be massacred, and they take all the gains, within minute zero of the IPO day.

The only way retail investors to gain something is by mere chance, holding for days or long term until the company does present real results, but for the underwriters and brokers they already made a x2 or x3 bagger by the time we are allowed to trade."

i bought xpev at 24.50 and its down to 21.39 i suck at investing.

Teach me your ways
"seriously great insight.  but i think from here on out, i'm going to avoid investing in asian stocks."
You're a NIO owner?
I really want to see how this battery swapping model pans out. Tesla considered it years ago but decided to not go ahead with such model.
People just need to hear that is takes 3 mins.. its a major selling piece even if not 100% required. Going for a 3min battery swap if you van charge at home is still very annoying. There is a reason that 95% of Teslas charge at home.. its sooo much better.
"Battery swapping is a good idea i think. Owners have the chance to upgrade their build as battery tech improves. Think of it as upgrading your PC parts for better ones. Owners don't have to buy a new car to access better battery tech. Owners also have the freedom to pick a more cost effective choice if they only drive short distances or swap for a long distance battery for a couple days, for example road trips, vacations etc. Also if somehow the battery cell gets damaged or dies, you can just swap it. With Tesla, you're stuck with the same battery so you would have to buy a new car. Even if they could repair it the process could take a weeks. I also heard that if your Tesla gets wrecked, it's near impossible to go and get parts to repair your vehicle."
"It's good if you only use it for quick replacement on long trips. Perfect for that, 3 minutes and boom you got another 400KM. But people need to charge at night at home, so they don't need battery swaps for short daily commute. Because then the queue becomes too long, suddenly an additional hundreds of people need to use it once a week. (Same with quickcharging really.)"
"I agree that from the customer perspective is a benefit and convenience. 
But from a business model perspective I'm concerned that it can become a very expensive model, imagine trying to estimate how many fresh batteries you need to have in a station.
They will end up with stations without fresh batteries, other stations with unused batteries.

All those assets (batteries) are just sitting carrying, in my opinion, a lot of risk and won't be producing much revenue. 

Time will tell."
Keep in mind that most Chinese families don't have garages. Charging over night isn't really an option.
Well through basic supply and demand they‚Äôd only create as many swap stations and batteries that is need to satisfy the supply. That‚Äôs just a given for any properly functioning business
"Half true. The people that own a Nio will 9-out-of-10 have an allocated underground parking spot. These are not outfitted with charging poles yet, but for sure in future they will. That would change the function of battery swap."
Easier said than done.
"Think about it for one second. It's just like gas stations or charging stations for EV's. To solve the storage problem, you can store the battery packs underground. This creates a consistent stream of income if people use their cars. It's obvious you would need to recharge the vehicle to operate otherwise it would run out of power. As for the source of electricity, solar is the future. Solar tech is getting better/cheaper every year. Elon musk is a visionary, society will eventually have to transition to sustainable energy. China has an air pollution problem, and if clean energy can solve that problem then ""blue skies are coming"""
"The fact that they went thru with BaaS even tho others like Tesla didn‚Äôt go with it tells me that have special economic and tech solutions to this service. 

Plus the swap stations are great advertising for the brand"
"Don't get me wrong. I'm.actually bullish and shareholder of NIO. Is just that this BaaS model is extremely risky in my opinion. I'm glad that I'm usually wrong in my forecasts.

I do give them a point because if BaaS is successful then NIO is locking in a stream of revenue, it's like ""selling"" the battery for a long time and the price of battery swap can be adjusted as they please, not like simply selling the battery today and not seeing a penny in future years. For that reason I think this could be a genius idea.

My problem is that batteries are the most expensive part of EV and simply having them sitting in stations hoping for possible clients to come and use them is very capital intensive. I don't agree that much will the analogy of a gas station, because NIO battery replacement only works for NIO cars. Gas stations can serve any car.

In any case I hope their share price goes to +$17 as I have some options expiring in November this year and I'm hoping to make a profit if the share price exceeds $17."
"There was a recent story suggesting Nio is going to try to leave mobileye and reboot their own self driving effort.

If that‚Äôs true, then you can say goodbye to Nio robotaxi revenue any year soon"
Source?
"https://36kr.com/p/836510690559746

You have to translate, and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true or not. Curious to hear thoughts."
If NIO tried to develop their own autonomous driving system why do they have to cancel the partnership with Mobileye? The partnership allows Mobileye to gain car technology and what NIO gains is a source of revenue from Mobileye buying their cars. Am I missing something here?
"They don‚Äôt.

But there was language in the article that suggested that they were trying to leave mobileye. 

Again, it may not be true, and the author may have been confused."
"It's listed under NIO on Yahoo finance so it may be of interest here too.

Other article about it:  [https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3098408/xpeng-seeks-raise-us11-billion-new-york-ipo-electric-car](https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3098408/xpeng-seeks-raise-us11-billion-new-york-ipo-electric-car)"
No one can predict but I wouldn't expect a Tesla dip until after the split
"Doubt it will hurt much in the long run. Two different companies, both have their own innovations, and Nio currently caters solely to the Chinese market. Also let‚Äôs not forget they‚Äôre nowhere near trading at a $1000 PE ratio!"
"I feel the other way around. Right now everybody is investing into TSLA because of high growth. But as soon as there will be a pullback, that money will go to Nio."
Yes
"Don't think so,  both have different catalysts.a complete sector doesn't go down because tsla does."
Market crash gonna pull errybody down.
If you can sell NIO with profit... sell and buy TSLA.
This is what I think will probably happen too
Do you want to elaborate?
"Disagree, Nio's potential upside is massive still. Tesla is already on Mars"
"Not really. You saw what happened in 2008, right?"
"Tesla is barely beginning. This is their first year with a positive balance sheet wait until they roll out the semis, new battery tech, FSD, etc"
I bought a bunch of nio at 12 and have been slowly selling off at higher prices as what buffett says slowly sinks into my mind. The fomo from telsa and such is definitely affecting peoples judgement.
What did Buffett say?
Let‚Äôs see what happens with this sub count in the following days üëÄ
Can someone please explain to me if they are diluting shares or not?
[deleted]
How much are you guys holding and at what price point?
Anyone know the current EV market share NIO has in China?
"Planning to buy 100 NIO Stocks tomorrow, Any suggestions ?"
Just about ready to pop I'd say !
Registration of shares =/= issuance of shares. Its not confirmed that there will be dilution so dont spread false information
So whats happening?
[deleted]
Why don't you start?
1000 & $9 . Got in early at $2.30 but also bought at 15 so here for long hall a little worried about 2nd week of September but We‚Äôll see
Just get me to $15.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I already have!
any reason why you're worried on that date?
Why are you in it for the short haul?
I'd take a weekly rise of over 7% and even a month rise of 16%.... the stock literally just exploded 300%+
So it means my 4 shares at roughly 14/per are gonna devalue. I should still hold though?
1320 @ $6.50

"That‚Äôs exactly what I want you to say, lie to me, tell me it‚Äôs gonna hit a million per share and that we‚Äôre all gonna get into Valhalla together."
almost at break even for me. i put an order in to sell at $32.
I‚Äôve been day trading in and out since 4$. Decided to get back in this week and hold. $20 by the end of year is my price target with solid month to month sales and increased production capabilities.
https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEIPRCGknndSryPb5KoSMqrQqFggEKg0IACoGCAowkqEGMJBZMNL5vAY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen
Anyone buy calls here??
I have been swing trading since $5 - What is your exit strategy on day trading?
20? If it gets to 15 I‚Äôll be doing flips.
Love this article because I had forgot about the mobileye/nio partnership. Always felt bad about missing the boat on mobileye
"IV is very low historically, so it would be wise yes. I am thinking to get some"
"I‚Äôve gotten pretty familiar with nios trends. I always sell at a big spike in the morning either pre market or right at market open. And then buy back later after first drop when the dust settles. I hardly hold over night anymore i just check what‚Äôs happening around 2am, 5am and either buy or wait at 6am CST. Positive 17k at the moment."
Better start stretching
I think end of year price will definitely be quite a bit higher than $15. Once NIO announce a timeline on increasing production the stock price will go up significantly.
Grabbed a couple up for mid September- will probably sell at spike after they announce August numbers - was a swing trader but turned long on it at 12.50 with 2500‚Äôshares.  Volatility seems to be stabilizing
Yeah I have noticed that spike on the morning open myself. I'm up 200% on an initial investment of 3k. Daily I tell myself to put more into NIO but I am trying to stay diversified. Dabbling in a few other sectors these days. Seems like there is opportunity everywhere!
Gotta stretch if we're gonna reach for the moon.
"There certainly is opportunity everywhere but I am staying cautious and more inclined to day trade as opposed to long holding due to uncertainty with election coming up. 

...And I need to stay away from airline sector....every time I think tsa numbers are up and it‚Äôs time to invest I end up losing hah. Oh well."
Yeah I agree. I was burned on UAL in March trying to cost average down. Luckily I made it back and then some!
"I‚Äôm hoping this brings about a good run, especially with August sales nearby."
It‚Äôs all speculation at this point
Isn't it more related to the battery as a service announcement they did?
"Even so talking about it is a sign of confidence that the troubles with financials are no longer a core concern for them. If expansion is on the cards that can only be a good thing overall. 

The second biggest issue NIO is facing after its financials is lack of presence outside China. If/once NIO can can break into Europe, it no longer falls into that China company bad company/China stock bad stock bracket. Ambitious but one day NIO could be a household name like Huawei."
"They only own 1/4 of the business and the service takes away from the price of the vehicle, however it will lower production costs of batteries, so in the long run it‚Äôll be worth. This announcement about Europe no matter how concrete shows more confidence in its financials. A company that looks to expand will only do so if it‚Äôs core business is stable."
Very good call that I hadn‚Äôt considered in regards to the ‚ÄúChina bad‚Äù thinking. Trump is our biggest short term risk with his annoying tweets
If you search NIO ES8 on Instagram people from Uzbekistan already own them. Arabs are also into it. NIO global Is already happening as we speak.
how will it lower production costs?
"If Biden gets in, no one will have money to put into the stock market."
It‚Äôs the western world that accounts for stock though unfortunately. If Europeans and Americans don‚Äôt see it on their streets it‚Äôs like it doesn‚Äôt exist to them.
Batteries are the most expensive component to an electric vehicle. Offloading that to another company will lower the amount of batteries produced by NIO add in the consistent monthly revenue by subscription and over time this pay off massively.
Wow it seems Trump has smoothed your brain too.
I don‚Äôt doubt that but it‚Äôs good to see that it‚Äôs not only the Chinese that are buying it. Slowly it‚Äôs going to make its way to Europe while slowing building that swapping infrastructure
"My understanding is that the new company is just an asset mgmt firm, no production firm. So the production stays where it was, with NIO, and the asset mgmt firm the buys the battery from then and manages all the leasing.. could be wrong"
"The main reason why I‚Äôm holding and buying when it‚Äôs low. There‚Äôs already a NIO dealer (for show) in California while distributing cars to Europe is in pending. Just have to overcome the Trump obstacle, get the battery switch stations done, and commercialize it... üöÄ"
It is an asset management firm but it is purchasing its own batteries and NIO is being commissioned to sell the service not the batteries.
Where in Cali. I live here there‚Äôs no dealership here
"https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/iijup0/baas_announcement_press_conference_august_20_2020/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

check the BaaS presentation by W. L. he states that the assemt mgmt firm buys the battery from NIO. Does not sound to me like the asset mgmt firm is producing the battery"
"I‚Äôve seen it, it‚Äôs near San Mateo I think... don‚Äôt 100% remember but I‚Äôve def seen the building"
That‚Äôs new information we didn‚Äôt have that before
They have an office campus for their tech department in Sunnyvale or San Jose but not a dealership. They call their dealerships NIO House I think
some things are left for interpretation ;-) you‚Äòre welcome
"San Jose. Oops, I thought it was a dealer. It's just their headquarters. Here we call it dealers. For NIO, it's called  NIO House where people can just hang out [https://www.nio.com/nio-house](https://www.nio.com/nio-house)"
What does that comment even mean?
People need to jump on this.
Great company hoping to really make some tendies
I bought 90 back in Feb (@$3)
I have 46 and I feel like it‚Äôs not enough. I don‚Äôt want to tell you to get more though. It‚Äôs up to how you feel about it
buy what you can afford
have about 10 000 shares at about 5$. Holding till this outperforms Tesla
"What are the biggest risks you guys consider with nio? I currently have 350 shares at an average of just under $5. This makes up about 50% of my portfolio (I just started about 5 months ago) I feel like I want to keep buying nio as I really think their going to make it long term 5-10 years. Am I crazy to keep buying more nio only, or should I diversify more? I feel like I‚Äôve already regretted not buying more at $3 when I had the chance, but like I said I was so new to investing."
I currently have 2 shares and was wondering if it would be a good idea to purchase more?
"So NIO is planning to go to Europe next year. Are they tackling SEA, India, Japan/Korea at all? Huge markets close by with large populations. I understand they face heavy competition vs the Korean and Japanese cars, but its the same with Europe"
I bought 1700 @$3
Has anyone purchased long term call options on NIO?
I have 1000 shares buy more guys this is like Tesla it will get there in 5 years
Congrats üî•
That‚Äôs awesome!
 I own roughly only like 270 shares
I have ~400 and i feel i need MORE !
I wish I knew about this stock earlier. 900 at $13
"My biggest concerns have less to do with Nio and more to do with the state of the stock market as well as American-Chinese relations moving forward, at least until we get dickhead out of office. Beyond those factors which are out of their control, I would like to see them get back on track with bringing more production in-house to bring down costs. I know COVID has held them back in that regard. 
  
There‚Äôs a lot to love about this company‚Äôs potential right now. Sales have a ton of room for growth, not only from retail customers but also through deals like the one with Mobileye. BaaS, Nio as a lifestyle brand, etc. could really make this stock soar over time."
"I definitely regret not buying more at $3 myself. NIO is about 25% of my portfolio right now, but more than half is EV startups. I've been investing in Li lately and plan on doing the same with Xpeng. But I also hold a little bit of all the other startups and quite a bit of EHang. As far as investing more in NIO right now, it's probably not a bad idea, especially if BaaS and international expansion work out this stock could easily climb towards the end of this year and next year."
Yes
I say go for it! As long as you can afford it though :)
Idk what you do in life but you may aswell retire my guy. Moneys gonna start pouring into your pockets soon enough
"Not yet, plan on buying some leaps next month though"
I bought $30 calls expiring in 2022
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hearing and what makes me want to buy more but I‚Äôm new to stocks so it freaks me out when I see it drop back super low.
Most small investors bought at that price point. And it was a very risky investment before all the positive news came out. I just believe in China and it's ability to grow.
"Does trunk really have that much power over the future of nio though? I understand he‚Äôs making the relationship with China a bit dicey, but how bad does nio really need America to succeed? If they move into Europe wouldn‚Äôt that be huge gains in itself?"
Thank you!
Thank you so much!
We can wish bro. The price its at now is still good enough to buy if we're projecting it to go 100 even 50 dollars within the next year or two
Why next month?
Invest in a company that you believe in and understand its business. Majority of the people are long term holding NIO here.
Just ride the lightning
"The biggest threats are those regarding delisting which, as it stands, shouldn‚Äôt affect Nio anyway. His rhetoric on China has resulted in many distancing themselves from Chinese stocks, which may play into why Nio‚Äôs stock price hasn‚Äôt taken off compared to lesser EVs. Overall I‚Äôm more concerned about how much the Fed has been doing to prop up the stock market, and whether/when it might come tumbling back down."
Got burned by the IV crush. Waiting for the August sales report to recoup some losses and then re-enter
Thank you for the advice. I plan to hold long term as well.
"Renting your battery is what Renault has been doing for years with Zoe.

Can someone explain to me the difference/benefits of Nio's solution?"
Then nio will own 25% of the Baas Thing?
"So what is the purchase price USD with gov incentives? This seems like a significant savings up front, while generating long term benefits to NIO and customer not having to worry about the battery.  Market does not seem to like it."
"The way I see it is that it‚Äôs not a bad option to have. It has down sides but for those who drive NIO cars for ‚ÄúDiDi‚Äù (Chinese version of Uber) this is such a great news. I‚Äôm not too worried about BaaS. All ppl are talking about it how it‚Äôs actually rising the cost of driving in long-term . All in all , I do believe there will be more trimming to this idea as we go along , a customer can never to giving too much option on how they wanna pay for their cars."
Edit: sorry. Article was removed
"Theres nothing innovative with NIO's BaaS. The only benefit is customer convenience, as the charging infrastructure isnt there yet. I don't even think the different pricing options for BaaS is a big difference maker."
"One big difference: Devaluation of battery is severe these days. 

Battery technology is improving too fast, the older batteries are devaluing at a much greater rate. Even Renault has ditched the option of monthly battery leasing for its electric Zoe at the end of 2019.

This is great news to consumers, but terrible for the company; Someone has to pay for the depreciation of batteries."
Difference is no one cares about Renault üòÇüòÇ
"Yes and no, yes because they will own 25% of the company which they made to produce And own the batteries and no because their cars and their Baas will still be owned by them"
"Initial responds from the market is expected.

If we ignoring the details, and look at this event in very simplistic manner This move can be seen as NIO selling off 75% of its battery department. 

There can be counter arguments on how this is a good move and whatnot, but those are in the details. The market usually respond to the macro first."
It looks like the cost rebate is equivalent to 6 years of leasing the battery. Which in itself is less than the time one should keep a brand new car especially an EV.
"Thanks for your reply, I didn't know that Renault ditched the model. 

One more reason for it not to be such a great news I guess unless they recycle the older batteries for powerwall usage after a swap."
They are selling more EVs than NIO.
But NIO has superior product
"It's not a reply to my question and totally irrelevant here.

They haven't innovated in anyway as far as I see so either I'm missing something or it doesn't matter that they do Baas as anybody can do the same.

Therefore, it's not be a moat as ARK invest would put it and nothing to be pumped about as an investor."
They have battery changing statioons in the bigges tEV market in the world. They have a superior battery/car/infrastructure in china.
"You are confusing Baas and battery swapping which are 2 different things. 

Also even if they are in the biggest EV market, the battery swapping stations while interesting is not scalable if they start to grow to hundreds of thousands cars on the road.

Just look how supercharging stations is a problem on big rush days for Tesla. 

How many and how big they would need to have/be if NIO had 500k or 1M cars on the road?

Tesla isn't doing battery swapping because it's not scalable and sustainable for real volumes.

But again that's irrelevant to my initial question."
"The more I read about BaaS, the more I like it. My biggest concerns with buying electric is battery range and degradation over time. This solves both issues. Driving around town? Small range pack. Going on a longer trip? Upgrade for the week. Never having to worry about battery maintenance and knowing that you can get the latest battery tech every year? Music to my ears. 

Can‚Äôt wait for Nio to be available in the US."
60% of my portfolio is now nio.
"BaaS base price with ES6 is $39,520.45"
"We have 10-12 days until the next delivery numbers. 

Be ready for a slow (or fast if Trump gets at it again) dump until the next pump.

Good luck everyone!"
"I can't even watch this, for something that was prerecorded its terrible audio. 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAEqtU2amF8&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAEqtU2amF8&feature=youtu.be)"
Don't know how the stock doesn't go up but I had GEVO so im happy today. Hope you all the best.
Not sure why the market didn‚Äôt react better to the news. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a case of ‚Äúwe‚Äôll believe it when we see it‚Äù and it‚Äôll jump as NIO keeps beating expected sales.
call it what you like. for me its a risk-apetite based longterm investment
"I really hate this stock so much. Stuck at $15. When there is good news, stock dips. When there‚Äôs bad news, stock dips even lower. Wtf?!"
"That's way too much considering that Tesla is the leader in the field for years too come imo.

A 80% Tesla-20% NIO would already be a big bet on NIO."
Is this after gov incentive?
That seems expensive without the battery
Does consistent dump and pump mean higher gains taxes vs one massive dump?
"The Baas news you mean? That's nothing that anybody else can't replicate.

Renault has been doing it for years with Zoe, I don't see what Nio ""invented"" there afaik.

Too many NIO investors were thinking that it would be NIO battery day to the like of Tesla on Sept 22nd but it's far from being a jump foraard, it's just a financing trick to make the care barely more affordable at a big cost/risk for NIO."
"NIO was $2 earlier this year, and is now 700% up. It is just taking a breather and will resume it's regularly scheduled programming shortly."
I held from $12-$2 drop your fine kid.
"Even if Tesla is the leader, which they are and probably will always be. The chance Nio stock doubles in price is much more likely than if Tesla doubles in price, because their market cap is quite high now. 

Buying Nio stock is not necessarily betting against Tesla. It's betting that Nio will have an easier time pushing 25 Billion than Tesla pushing 750 Billion."
"Depends what the 60% is though. If the 60% is say $1000 it‚Äôs really not that much. Also depends on strategies, I personally am a high risk investor I specifically choose to invest in failing companies I believe can turn the tide. I‚Äôve been a NIO holder since $3 and it‚Äôs now my biggest percentage stock. I‚Äôve also invested in Aston Martin since 40p and and William hill since 70p. Granted I don‚Äôt always win such as luckin coffee, intu and Thomas cook but my wins by far out weigh my losses."
Or your dealer does not accept split shares so NIO is much more flexible
"Yes - price incl all savings is 270,000 RMB about $39 k USD"
"$51,711.70 is the full price with battery comparable to US Tesla Model Y $49,990"
"You are taxed when you trigger a taxable event. The ups and the downs of the market don't matter if you're already holding a position. Once you sell, you book your gain and then pay tax on it."
"I dont know, I dont plan on paying taxes at anytime on my gains."
How about that BLNK news though?
"Renault no longer do what you are claiming: 

""Renault ends battery leasing for electric Zoe""

https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/renault-ends-battery-leasing-electric-zoe


Edit: They were also not swappable on a daily basis like what NIO is trying to do. They were just upgradeable upon wear or technology improvements."
it‚Äôs the fact that i have been holding for 50 days already. It‚Äôs seriously annoying to see it stagnate under $15.
"While I understand what you mean, I disagree with the statement. 

Tesla is more likely to double than Nio to get to 26$ in the year to come imho.

Nio's risk/reward ratio is very high as long as there is tension between US & China."
">whatever the size of your portfolio, having 60% in a company at risk of being delisted with just a signature on a piece of paper is not investing but gambling at the moment.

Too lazy to rewrite but that's what I replied above."
Wow. Imagine if they release a Model 3 equivalent!
The demand has to settle in a little before production costs can go down so I‚Äôm hoping it can be a cheaper substitute to tesla
Frankly I would buy the Y is you put these car and price next to one another. Software in the model Y worth some weight to me. How is the autopilot in Nio compared to Tesla‚Äôs.
Well that may not end well for you
I must have missed it. What's the news about?
"Also, why does it matter if Nio wasn‚Äôt the first or only company doing battery swaps? If their method or system is better that‚Äôs what counts. Very often the top  players in the industry were not the first to market, they were simply the best."
"I didn't know that they stopped.

As I said in another comment, battery swap isn't scalable."
Time to close your brokerage app and check in again 360 days from now üëå
The problem is you‚Äôre assuming Nio can‚Äôt exist without Tesla. Tesla gains are always good for Nio and having more shares with the more affordable Nio price means bigger net gains when it grows. If you can buy 300 shares of Tesla id def suggest doing that but if you have $500 you can afford to lose I would put 70% in Nio
"You are right, and I will not hold all of these nio shares for that long, I will probably sell 30 percent in the next 3 months as I think they can easily push $20 in the coming months."
Likely but I don't think it's going to end well in general anyway
https://seekingalpha.com/news/3607062-blink-charging-lower-after-short-seller-powers-in-accusations. The first page of the report is pretty damning
It's up to NIO to prove everyone wrong. We will see if that actually eventuates or not.
"I'm just saying that having 60% of your portfolio in NIO is higher risk and the point of investing is to maximize your returns.

Nio is a great speculative play and they will likely get at least 10-15% of the Chinese (maybe even global) market if they keep going like they are on the long run.

But whatever the size of your portfolio, having 60% in a company at risk of being delisted with just a signature on a piece of paper is not investing but gambling at the moment.

Also having 60% in Nio means that you have at best 40% in Tesla which is a bigger winner especially in the weeks past and to come until Q3 earnings."
"I've been in and out for the past 2 years,out at the moment since 13.79$"
Yeah just depends on goals. A lot of Nio investors myself not included are in it for short gains.
"I am 100% in NIO. There is some risk, but it is overhyped. I risk the small chance of it going to 0, considering the tremendeous upside potential"
Also if joe Biden gets elected there‚Äôs no way it will get delisted.
Even more reason to bet on Tesla instead of NIO in the coming weeks/months.
"You're then gambling and not investing. 

That's a fine choice if you don't mind losing your money."
"Well, not sure about that or the fact that it won't end up in a civil war after the election result.

Trump has no limit, he killed thousands of USAn in the past few months mishandling the pandemic and now he's going to kill even more destroying USPS for those relying on it to get their treatments etc...

He's already in full propaganda to not accept the result if he lose and his MAGA supporters are dumb enough to fight for him.

But I digress there."
"interesting how terms are being mixed up here. I am a longterm investor, investing based on my risk apetite, period. If you call my investment in NIO gambling, then by definition you call your investment in NIO (how much of the PF it may be), also gambling."
I actually really like the blue they produce. It looks really good on the car.
I was hoping NIO will make battery exchange stations before releasing cars in the US. I thought it would be a good way to attract curious eyes to anticipate buyers. Now the US have NIO cars but drivers aren‚Äôt benefitting off of battery exchange stations like in China (unless they can at the dealer?)
"‚ÄúLook at those *wheels*!‚Äù

I was hoping for in depth interior walk through but this was funny."
"How long has NIO been in the US? 
I had no idea they had arrived in North America. 
This is absolutely great!!!!"
"That front hood is massive. Anyone know if it opens (is there a frunk)?

The car looks great, but just curious about that massive hood."
"LETS GOO
I want one asap"
That was kind of dumb. But I‚Äôm excited.
Blue skies coming - so this color is very fitting!
There are no Nio cars in the states yet. This is just a display. Nio is only sold and driven in China at the moment.
I wish!! Empty lot = empty building. Everyone tele-commuting during pandemic. I was lucky they had it parked outside. I stopped by a month or so ago and there wasn't anything but the logo out front. I can't wait for Covid to settle down and we get our lives back!
As someone who literally works down the street from their office I didn't even know their office existed there until recently.
NIO does not sell vehicles in the US yet. I believe they have had this US headquarters since their founding as NextEV.
Thanks for the clarification. I was wondering why there were some Youtube videos of them.
Keep us posted if you see the parking lots full again. I will go back for a tour.
It will be a while. I haven‚Äôt been into the office since March.
I literally am invested in this company to the T to where it‚Äôs become a goal to keep learning about it every single day. I <3 NIO
Lets get to 15 today
Hopefully ATH EOW
"Question: the US government has issued a warning that if Chinese companies continue to reject audits, they‚Äôll be delisted from the US market. Is NIO in that pool?"
"Feels like big money isnt letting NIO get too far ahead of itself. We‚Äôre  in a consolidation phase. My guess is 6 months before major uptick.

It‚Äôll stay around these levels until next earnings. 

If we beat or show growth I wouldn‚Äôt expect us to spike. It‚Äôll be the green light for institutional investors to let NIO run again. If we miss, then we‚Äôre tanking down. 

By q4, if we report strong growth for the 3rd consecutive time then it‚Äôll be a straight shot to 20+.

Thoughts?

My hope is that EC6 will sky rocket NIO. Just from a consumer standpoint in US, the car looks legit lol"
My pp hard
Big week! üöÄ
"The less enthusiasm shown by retail NIO investors, the more likely it runs up."
Should I be worried about nio as US may delist Chinese stocks?
"I got a YouTube be notification from NIO earlier today for BaaS launch event, but the video said private when I clicked on it."
"I ended up selling all my shares at $14.65 yesterday, it was a fun ride. I still have faith long term but i believe it will take some heavy blows untill mid september."
Yeah let's get it to where i bought it in the first place
I feel it will end at 14.20 today
All chinese companies. But if thats going to happen you will know that and have your time o react.
This is a great question. NIO uses PWC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) as their USA accredited CPA/auditor. NIO using PWC makes them currently in compliance with what the USA government is enforcing. It‚Äôs really ridiculous they‚Äôre finally now just enforcing the rules.
"No, they can‚Äôt delist, because economies are totally dependant on each other"
Part of me say he‚Äôs all talk but not going to do it because we‚Äôre reliant on Chinese economy
"I just posted this answer above. 


This is a great question. NIO uses PWC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) as their USA accredited CPA/auditor. NIO using PWC makes them currently in compliance with what the USA government is enforcing. It‚Äôs really ridiculous they‚Äôre finally now just enforcing the rules."
What‚Äôs happening mid September?
Which is?
This didnt age well
"I hope so. There's [news](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-18/state-department-urges-colleges-to-divest-from-chinese-companies) stating otherwise 

Theres a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ic8q5r/us_warns_colleges_to_divest_china_stocks_over/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) about it as well :/"
I don't think the market has fully cashed in the outstanding convertible notes. (Worth about 200 million)
"15.30 LOL


I bought in asap after the Q2 report cos my inexperienced mind of the stocks & shares world thought that good news would make the value go up, i didnt realise good news = bad. Cos as soon as i bought it plummeted like a sack of shit. Even if i was 3 seconds late i would have seen it drop. But oh well its a long term hold for me, and only 25 shares atm. Will try not to lose sleep over it"
Welp 14.05. Aging slowly eh
"Even though they would somehow manage to delist, it says by the end of next year, so we are all safe for now"
You're doing better than me. 100 shares at 15.91 over here.
You're fine. Try to average down on dips.
Atleast im not the only one. Not that itll matter in the long run üëçüèº
I will in future. Lot of faith in nio

I really need to get twitter... Thanks
"It‚Äôs because I sold, you‚Äôre all welcome"
"Yeah it will rise and then fall and then rise again for a long time. Just hope the trend is always up. I remember hoping that we'd eventually break $10 not too long ago and now $12 seems like the floor.

Strap in"
$100 in 5 years
Don‚Äôt trust pre market and one good day doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll always be up
Unless something drastic happens.... just set it and forget it...
I love you guys
Why is this news? Stocks go up and down
Bruh. No shit..
Are people covering their shorts?
"I got a call option for Nov 20, 2020 strike price $17, bid for $2.10.
Will I make money? What do you think?"
Lets just split 5 for 1 now like TSLA...
What's people's thoughts on USA talking about delisting Chinese companies?
Can‚Äôt wait to moon over $15 üöÄüöÄ
"Not again ! 
Pre market is a trap ."
Omg now we'll never go under 14 again!
500 in 5 years. 100 by this time next year
"Yes, it‚Äòs just good to see it resurrecting ;)"
Ah it just feels good to post something about NIO here without being roasted by the community. Not like in r/wallstreetbets haha.
"Well, the market would be boring if stock movements aren‚Äôt considered as news."
Maybe
"They are going to delist only specific companies. According to the comments from the topic r/stocks sub, NIO is not on the list."
The DD of some dude on reddit predicted price target of $90 in 3 years. I‚Äòm holding until then ;)
"Lol I‚Äôd love that

With the battery swap tech I think it‚Äôs possible"
"Sadly, I‚Äôve seen some people ‚ÄúDD‚Äù NIO to hit 50 next week. I‚Äôm still long with NIO, but many people are overhyping."
Hope it go past $100 after 3 years
$50-$60 by end of this year.
"I agree. Nobody can predict the future. 
I just feel as confident as you for the long run."
To the mooooooon üöÄüåù
"If I had to guess I could see the stock testing new highs by the end of this week. Whether the stock can begin to stabilize in that next tier is up for debate. But, hey, judging by the volatility in the face of previous batches of good news I may be entirely off the mark. That said, today was a good day for Nio stock as it was. The timeliness of this announcement combined with the rally around Tesla could precipitate a surge (remember, oftentimes upward trends on Tesla stock have coincided with upward trends on Nio and other EVs)."
 I don't think there is an official announcement yet? So we will see.
"Someone posted a tray good theory as to why nio  crashed after earnings, and why it will happen again in September. Something with bonds I think. Not sure."
"*I don't think there is*

*An official announcement*

*Yet? so we will see.*

Got a link? I am intrested too on why they had a crash after earnings.
Probably investors being skeptical about baas and no mention of future global export.

"This is a post from WSB that mentions possible price drop due to large selling of convertible notes by investment firms around next delivery announcement date of September 5th.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9gfta/nio_updates/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
"Lurker here - This seems plausible but keep in mind if you decide to sell, Aug delivery numbers will probably also come out this week."
"What makes you think they'll be released this week? Wouldn't it make more sense for it to be next week or the first week in September?

Even if the convertible notes thing is true I don't see it tanking nearly as hard as it did this last earnings."
*meant to say the numbers would come out the same week as this bond conversion.
"I think the next few weeks/months will be interesting for the company and Monday‚Äôs price bump reflects that.

New appointment of a self driving head with proven experience in the field, Nio Nomi interface winning a 2020 Red Dot award, China announcing a stimulus package which should boost consumer confidence... BaaS development news coming. 

There are a lot of positive catalysts that should translate into shareholder confidence and increased investment/share price. 

I also really want to see Tesla succeed, because I think anyone looking at a Tesla Model 3, Y or X in China is also going to consider Nio and will be hard pressed to choose between the two options and may ultimately choose Nio as they offer a comparably attractive package of price, service and premium features. 

Although... the one car Nio is missing in their line-up is a competitor to the Model S. Hopefully they are targeting to introduce a ~80-100k priced sports car/sedan option by 2021.

Looking forward to market open!"
"I am really tired of people telling me this company won't succeed because its Chinese.

 They type it from their iPhones while playing Smash Bros on their Nintendo switch and drive a car from Germany to work for a company that was made by a man from another country and they have the audacity to say things like ""nio won't succeed, its Chinese, US investors don't trust Chinese "" 

I'm tired of seeing it, it doesn't make any sense. Go find me 10 items in your house not made in China that aren't accessories. Our countries are intimately linked via production and economy. Its a fact.

Point something out to me about this company's earnings, deliveries, or products you think will stop it from succeeding.

Talk to me about how they're far from profit at this point.

Anything actually about economics.

But don't simply say ""its chinese it won't make it"" Its hypocrisy, and racist."
"The most important index I am watching is TSLA, when the sell off begins and I believe it will be quite soon, how will it affect NIO?"
"It took almost 3 weeks and then a split announcement for TSLA to retake the highs right around ER. The equivalent trade action would be for NIO to drop back down to $12 in 2 weeks and then run to $20 in the following week. Now, NIO's price action won't be the same... and of course, news trumps all.

There is still tons of OI in the $15, 15.5, and $16 strikes. These will all be resistance. A catalyst can cause the sp to run through these and get delta hedging in favor of the bulls, but for this week at least, it will probably be a slog unless some sort of news takes over the action.

Battery leasing details might not be enough.

At least in Sept we have August production and delivery report. The Sept monthly $15 strike has a lot of OI and it is still pretty price... IV% in the high 80's, but if the sp can get past that, it can be a tailwind.

Could be that spill over enthusiasm from TSLA helps... if TSLA looks boring, then a pile of investors may decide to run up NIO instead."
discovered NIO because of TSLA. I am long NIO and long TSLA. I see great potential from NIO from customer stand point. I read all the news and review from Chinese forum. They are mostly positive.
What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs EOW prediction?
The nio eve is so dank
"I wouldn't say racist.

There are very real challenges for a Chinese company to make it elsewhere, many of which have nothing to do with race.

Now, out of all the significant Chinese automakers, I think NIO has a good shot of making it onto the world stage and some of that is due to its international development teams."
Do they even sell in US? Why wouldn't a Chinese car company succeed in China?
">I am really tired of people telling me this company won't succeed because its Chinese.

No one's saying the company wont succeed. Rather, the stock price wouldn't be as hot as tesla. Investors dont dabble in a company's stock just because it's successful, other factors come into play, such as their perception of the company. Just look at all of the chinese stocks listed on nasdaq and nyse, none have insane growth rate or stock prices even though they are doing well. 

Speaking of nio's stock price. I've seen people saying it will be $200 or even $500 in 5 years. I think thats really naive or maybe they're just trolling. It took tesla stock 3 years to grow from $20 to sub $200 after posting its first quarterly net profit, and another 7 years to sub $2000 after consistent quarterly net profits."
"Good points. I 100% agree from a consumer standpoint NIO has the foundation, market and product to succeed. However as an investor there is always that scare with foreign companies. You can say it might be racism, but until geopolitical issues subside, fraud is cracked down, tighter accounting etc, Chinese companies will continue to be undervalued vs American companies"
[deleted]
EOW will be $14.58
15? Hopefully
"Thats a valid point. I'm referring to comments going ""its chinese it won't make it haha"" and shit like that. I've seen that a couple times. Its annoying. Thats all I'm saying."
"They are planning to expand to US and europe. I believe they will succeed in China definitely. I dont like hearing people say ""won't succeed its chinese"" and thats their whole comment. Seen it like 5 times on this subreddit and wanted to address that. It adds nothing to any discussion."
And Wallstreet will continue to rob everyone blind and do whatever they want. I guess Americans prefer their own corrupt practices better than other peoples. Its all a joke to me.
"Well when it hit 1800 a month ago there was definitely a sell off. I donno if that doesn't qualify as a sell off in your book, but TSLA is a crazy stock and anything can happen I guess."
How specific. Care to tell us how you got that number?
$16ü§ûüèº
"Ofc its frustrating , but there is nothing racist about It."
"A lot of them seem like telsa fanatics and they just look for any opportunities to tell competitors they will fail. Had one last night tell me nio won't succeed because telsa abandoned the battery switching technology. And I was asking about how the swap stations recharge batteries,  nothing to do with tesla. I just point out the topic switch and don't continue the conversation."
[deleted]
"Some fundamentals and technical analysis. But I'm not an expert. 
I see a big jump coming by EOW obviously due to the news on BaaS but there will be a subsequent sell off by those who want to take profits in the last hours of Friday.

Next week the support (or floor) will be hovering at around $14.50 for the rest of August. Then for Sept I think the floor will be $15.50 and by Earnings Call in Oct the share price will have a floor of around $16 to $17.

I suspect brutal volatility in this ""linear upward trend"", it will be common to see +/- 13% volatility.

But I can clearly see both on the fundamentals and the technical that NIO has upward momentum."
What I am quoting sounds racist to me. Calling it how i see it
"I don't know what to say other than keep doing your DD. These people don't do a lot of research. Its pretty clear they are taking headlines and hearsay at face value and then being distracted by Facebook or something. Idk. Can't wait to be busy enough not to look at reddit ill tell you that. But for now I'm legit in lower middle class and I see this company looking like the mext TSLA but in china, and I'm like hey giant ticket up ill go ahead and take one please..."
Call it extreme volatility if you prefer but when a stock goes parabolic it always follow with a sell off.
The BAAS is really giving NIO the room it needs to expand and increase profits.
"What happens when 10 years down the road (no pun), you have 10 nio cars waiting in line at one swapping station. Offering baas has more cons than pros in imo, more labor required (not just those manning the swap station, but the entire logistic), company also has to stock up on batteries etc"
"I'm all in for NIO, but NIO right now has far and few cars on the road and according to reports, you usually have to wait for a fully charged battery from the changing station... How is this going to be a better solution when they are selling 1,000,000 cars a year?"
Same can be said about tesla but nio takes 3 min to charge compared to tesla which is 30 - 45 min.
"If it gets too stressed out by the number of cars waiting in line , ppl would probably just charge it at home. 5 minutes for changing battery is not bad to me. I‚Äôm pretty sure infrastructure will grow along with this sales.they charge $30 per vehicle, this is another source of income."
are battery swap stations really hard to install can't they just simply have more?
"Theoretically they should be able to charge batteries faster then tesla, they can use a consumer unfriendly charger in the back of the station with a better cooling system, and they can upgrade it whenever they want since it just sits in there own warehouse. Why are they messing this up so bad, is the lack of capital limiting the number of chargers per station?"
"Their battery swap stations aren‚Äôt scalable. Legit concerns. 

They‚Äôll have time to adjust hopefully. Right now they just need growth."
"A NIO doesn't take 3 minutes to charge, it takes 3 minutes to SWAP a battery. My comment stands on how long it takes to charge a spent battery and how NIO currently (from online reports) makes you wait to get a fully charged battery. If they are having the issue now, what's going to happen when its 10x the number of cars on the road."
Nio drivers make a reservation on the nio app to avoid long lines
"Nio‚Äôs battery swap stations are modular and the size of around 4 parking stalls. They are installing one per week around various Chinese cities until end of the year. 

I feel like that‚Äôs a good pace. They are definitely building up the infrastructure to scale with car sales."
"I don't know, all I know is that Tesla tried this in the states and they shut it down. If there's one thing I know is that when Tesla puts her mind to something if it's meant to be successful it will be. For some reason this company's managing to make this a successful transition, but I think they're going to run into a problem with scalability. Additionally, I think in the United States there's a reason Tesla dropped it. Right now the Battery Technology is not there and make this an amazing solution it still takes 40 minutes for a battery of fully recharge do they can get the batteries to recharge at a shorter time and I can see this being more scalable. Before right now the amount of cars on the road they're already having a backlog of cars now imagine if they double in size"
Only good response lol.. thank you.
Your a little obsessed with telsa eh? I feel like your barely even responding to what I wrote.
"Yes it will be a problem for NIO to scale by itself, the capital, infrastructure required would be immense. Good thing NIO is offloading BaaS to a seperate company, which NIO would not even be a majority shareholder so  that they can focus on cars."
">currently (from online reports) makes you wait to get a fully charged battery. If they are having

It's hard to do that in China. IN US you had massive amounts of room. China lots of people live in highrises and massive charging networks wont work as good."
k
"This has nothing to do with my original statement. People, read. Please lol. The batteries takes 45 minutes to charge. They only have a LIMITED number of batteries per station. They ALREADY have more cars than batteries at any time. HOW will they scale this and fix the issues of making you wait for a fully charged battery?"
How does that relate to anything I said? My original concern has not been addressed by anyone.
"You ask about scalability issues and forget we are talking about China. They can build a high rise condo in a week. Think before you post. We are dealing with two different countries. Also my comment is referring to NIO which wont have to deal with this scalability issue, which would be a good thing for investor."
"I mean USA you got more space so it doesn't make sense to have a swap station and a charging station. But in chinas its kind of a necessity due to space constraints. And I dont see why in the future they cant make a series of swap stations charging stations similar to gas stations, except for battery swaps. 

&#x200B;

Personally I've never used a Tesla but I would rather take 5 minutes to do a swap than wait 30-40 for a charge, but i would like freedom to choose whether i want a swap or want to wait for a charge"
"So because NIO advertises this and will no longer be responsible, meaning someone else is left to ""hopefully"" make it work, is suppose to ease investors? The world more valuable company, Apple, precisely moved away from this because they know end to end control = product you want. you still haven't answered my question and are just throwing Nikola like phrases out. ""It's China they know how to scale"".> Also my comment is referring to NIO which wont have to deal with this scalability issue, which would be a good thing for investor."
"Dude, the issue is still there.. these batteries are not full when you arrive. The videos posted say you show up and the full batteries have been used and now it's only charging ones that you can take or wait for a full charge.

Again, how is this going to scale when we have 100x more cars on the road?"
"That someone else left to make it work would be the Chinese government, in combination with BJEV and NIO. If you really want to bet against them go ahead. I dont know what else to say. Clearly there is a demand for BaaS, and clearly its currently working. If more battery swap stations are needed they can simply build more. If more money is needed the Chinese government can provide more. Its really that simple. I think maybe you are concerned when NIO goes global? Otherwise BaaS in China is a win for me."
"I think there's confusion. My issue isn't with BaaS, it's, how is China and NIO, going to scale this solution when there are 300k cars on the road? One station can only hold x number of batteries and each battery needs 45 minutes to charge. 

Demand exceeds supply and I don't see how they can match it. So, how do you create something where you can pull up and get a fresh battery (as planned) and not wait 45 minutes for one to be fully charged.

Also, I'm very long on NIO. my position is heavy. Same with Tesla. I want both to do exceptionally well"
"Sure. I agree on the point that BaaS doesnt make sense when you have a fully mature EV population. I Assume you havent forgotten you can just normally charge your NIO car like you do with any EV. Battery swap stations was always a short term option, the charging infrastructure is not there yet and fast charging technology not in place. Youd think they will eventually phase out BaaS in the major cities when the charging system is fully set up. Why set up appointments for a battery swap when you can fast charge in the parking lot of some shopping mall?

One thing that is quite well thought out is these battery swap stations are mobile. So when there is no demand, they can move and set it up elsewhere etc."
Similar article from bloomberg: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-17/tesla-china-registrations-slow-as-competition-heats-up
June is qtr end for Tesla.. so that is probably why. Just noise IMO.
[deleted]
>Why It Matters:¬†The registrations for the Palo Alto-based company‚Äôs vehicles declined at a time when it faces increased competition from both local and global automakers in China.
Wouldn‚Äôt that mostly be due to COVID and therefore consumers seeing a decrease in income and savings ?
"Elon Musk once said: ""Tesla‚Äôs true competition is not the 'small trickle of non-Tesla cars being produced', but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world‚Äôs factories everyday"".  

Comparing the output of Tesla with Toyota, it's easy to agree with his viewpoint. Therefore, even if you strongly support NIO, you should wish Tesla do good too, because it's leading the way, opening up the EV market. Easy way to put it: when TSLA price goes up, NIO price goes up too.

There'll be a day where NIO goes head-on against Tesla as a competitor... but that'll be far in the future; NOW is not the time for NIO vs Tesla, focus should be placed on EV vs gas guzzlers."
Potentially. NIO also experienced a dip in sales but they attributed it to the flooding. Could be a whole industry thing but a 24% drop is quite significant.
"Don‚Äôt be that person. NIO‚Äôs success doesn‚Äôt require Tesla‚Äôs demise.

As for Tesla‚Äôs registration numbers, not all Tesla
vehicles are made in China. Some of them, including Performance Model 3‚Äôs, all S/X come from Fremont which means the 3rd month of a quarter is always much higher than the other two months. So every quarter, the first month of a quarter is a big drop off from the last month of a quarter. Been this way since Tesla entered through China market and for years, people have misunderstood this.

This effect will reduce as more of the production is done in China. It used to be, 3rd month was more than the 1st two combined, so we would see news stories about how the registrations/deliveries plunged 75%. And then various bears will say Tesla is done, cooked. By the end of the quarter, they would be surprised."
Are you talking about COVID in the states? These are China numbers. Their whole country is back to work sincr April
Thanks for explaining. I just quoted the article btw.
Thanks for sharing!
great video!
All hail Li Bin!

They can asked to rent and not own. Normal people need assets as collateral for future bank loans and such. They can get through the swings of rent prices without worry.
"Nice, I was thinking that I should know more about him too while reading Elon's biography by Ashlee Vance. Great timing."

"I agree, the creator did it brilliantly"
Guys don‚Äôt be day traders. Learn to hold the stock for long term.
"Hope it does. 
I have more than 5000 stock and not selling till they hit 300$. And still adding more on the dips"
Answer is...No.  Hoping for $15 by the fall.
"You can‚Äôt compare NIO and TSLA yet.. NIO is years behind TSLA, but yes there‚Äôs a lot of upside for NIO in the years to come as they roll out more cars and up their deliveries.

With the tension in China, which hurts investors confidence in Chinese stocks, but in someway this also helps NIO. NIO has large fundings from China‚Äôs banks and Tencent, and will probably end up as one of China‚Äôs main EV players. As sense of nationalism grows, I think more Chinese will want to buy their own cars not American cars like TSLA, and NIO cars are more affordable too. It‚Äôs gonna hit $100 at some point, probably couple years down the line"
I say easyyy... $100 stock. Nikola is at $50 without a product. While NIO is producing 10k per quarter. It‚Äôs just a matter of time before price üí•üöÄto the upside
"The answer if they will grow as they have grown by now is yes, the only question is when"
I have 500‚Ç¨ worth of Nio stocks. I expect to be a millionaire by August of next year. /s
Just in 2020 Tesla stock $20
I respect that
"Start investing right before you think nio will post its first quarterly NET profit. It wont be so soon, so no point buying in at the moment."

There you go!! Strong hands right here!!!

Lol
"how do you know if NIO is years behind or days or weeks? dont make shit up, you seem to be invested in tesla. Compare the sales to stock price of tesla vs nio. It should already have been at around 40$"
"Great analysis by the way! I would add that TSLA‚Äôs comparison to NIO is only meant to highlight TSLA journey since Tesla is older and has been in this price discovery phases before. NIO‚Äôs price discovery might not be the same to that of TSLA, but maybe similar.

Yes, political tensions may be an issue but it won‚Äôt affect every business between USA and China. The economies are too intertwined. Think of it, China is supplying most of PPE equipments to USA for COVID. I don‚Äôt see how this could slow down NIO. NIO is based in China and all the sales are comes from China."
If you have over $100k in shares right now you‚Äôll be a millionaire when it hits triple digits
"Its a matter of perception, more than anything. Although nkla is a scam imo, the hype is kinda there for its stock. Then you have nio which is from china, which you know, leaves a mixed impression to the people in the west, especially in north america.

Nio can be a company like tesla in terms of the the goods and services it provides, but i dont think it will be the next tesla in terms of share valuation.  Id be surprised if it breaks $50 in 5 years."
Nikola also has some orders which would generate greater revenue than Nio instantly. I'm all for Nio and I'm invested but I'm also not delusional. Being an American start up is way easier than a Chinese one; especially when we're talking about the stock market.
I think the main problem is nio is a Chinese company.
"Tesla stock which is lot more expensive compared to NIO moved in 1 year from $200 to $1700. How much more do you think NIO can move, a $13 stock? 
NIO could easily explode to $50 in days, to $100 in weeks, and to $1000 in a few years."
Short time frame. You will need more money invested or wait a little bit more years. This is no a get rich quick scheme
"Dude.. TSLA started in 2003... Their R&D is years ahead in terms of data they have for autonomous driving and battery development. And also it's Elon Musk, that guy is not human in terms of the innovation and the stuff he's working on (all with proven success too). 

You may think it's $40, but that's not what the market agrees. If it was truly worth $40, it would have been at least above $20 by now, and you would not have seen the sell off after NIO released its earnings"
You‚Äôre delusional. They‚Äôre years behind lol
"Agree. Nikola has no product yet. They haven‚Äôt even built their factory yet and the stock is $50. Nikola CEO said that their factory will finish in 3 yrs. I don‚Äôt think investors have that much time to wait. Soon the stock will start to retract as investors get fatigued.

On the other hand NIO has the opportunity to corner the Asian market. 1.4 billion people there, huge market. If they continue to increase productions, 10k vehicles as of 2nd quarter earnings, NIO could easily be be a $200 within one year."
NIO is not trying to capture American market for now. They have a huge China market to satisfy first.  China start up have it easy too because they‚Äôre subsidized by govt. They recently received a billion from local govt. All in all NIO are building more cars every quarter. Whereas Nikola is all hype
"> Nikola also has some orders which would generate greater revenue than Nio instantly

yes, true, but in 2023. until then it wont earn even a penny. so zero revenue until that point. so why all the fuss now? nothing more than a bubble fair to say. The only issue with NIO is that it is chinese company and hence the fear, nothing more."
"There is also a lot of red tape in USA compared to China. Call it regulation, or ‚Äúsafety standards‚Äù it‚Äôs all red tape"
"Isn't that the exact reason NIO will be successful? I don't follow your logic.

 They were created in China,  by a man from there, for Chinese consumers.

 If you don't think they will succeed because they are Chinese, is that racism or are you saying because US is racist ?

Im really not following you here.."
That‚Äôs racist
"Shortterm it won‚Äôt be as good, longterm is the way for NIO, Tesla wasnt profitable for about 10 years, NIO is already profitable. The only problem is that it is Chinese stock, otherwise it would be huge. And Tesla is much much bigger than NIO, but if NIO continues to progress like it did by now, then we could see 100 by the end of 2021, maybe sooner. The bright side is that NIO is backed by government so I believe that they won‚Äôt fail."
"Comparing stock prices doesn‚Äôt make sense. Compare market cap. NIO already went from $1.x to $17.x in the past year.

At $17 billion @ $14.x, NIO‚Äôs market cap is already 5% of TSLA. At a stock price of $280 for NIO, it would be about the same market cap as TSLA today. Just doubling to $25-30 would match TSLA‚Äôs low in 2019. Is NIO‚Äôs business prospects and state equivalent to Tesla in 2019? I don‚Äôt think so, not yet, but sp doesn‚Äôt always link up that way. However, it does frame the discussion."
"You do realize nio has 1.2-1.3 billion outstanding shares.

It took tesla 3 years from ipo to go from $20 to sub $200 after posting its first quarterly net profit in 2013, hovered at $200-300 for 6 years due to losses, and to sub $2000 in the past year due to consistent positive net profits. 10 years to break $1000 and its a household name in every continent. I dunno what makes you think nio stock is the next tesla.

Realistically its best to start buying into nio before its first quarterly net profit and not today. Increasing revenues and deliveries will drive the price up a little but i forsee the stock hovering around $12-$18 in the next 2 years."
I was clearly being sarcastic
"I do hold nio stocks myself but $200? I highly doubt it, no offence."
"Yepp they do, I agree. Even if they're successful in China, US and others countries rather bet on american companies in general which is understandable due to good reasons."
"If you want nio stock to 10x, you really need the cars to be available in north america. Because thats where both retail and institutional investors have something tangible to hype up."
Problem is investors don't have confidence to invest in nio because of the tension between the US and China.
NIO isn't currently profitable
Tesla was also backed by the government in its early days
So true...
"Right. But what do you think about the company itself? Its clear they are/ will be successful. Barring the geopolitical climate do you see the potential?

Personally I feel people afraid of that sort of thing are still stuck in an old way of thinking, and ill continue to pick up my discounted shares for now..."
Good point! But whenever there is money to be made. Tension issues will be resolved
"Their gross margin went to positive numbers for First time, they have enough demand, and they are significantly raising the numbers every month+they plan expansion to Eu or Us, I don‚Äôt see any reason that they shouldnt be profitable. Even if they arent profitable now, they will surely be profitable soon. Not to mention, that they managed to lower their costs and expenses"
"I had 200 shares, but I sold them all at $15. 
I also think nio is a good company to invest for long term, so I have been buying once it drops below $12."
"I dont disagree with you. Just correcting your statement where you said NIO is already profitable. I do think NIO has a quicker path to profitability. The market and technology is already there and available, a lot less hurdles to jump."
Great pointü§î
Ah okay. I got in around 2 dollars a share. Well honestly i lost my ass when it went from 7 to 2 then I reinvested a lot at 2 and you know the rest. I'm hoping to hold and use NIO as a cornerstone in my portfolio while it rises. Hoping to be able to sell about 500 shares when it reaches around 60 and let the rest ride.
Nikola is $50 and they haven‚Äôt even made a single vehicle. All in promise and their stock is $50. While NIO is delivering 10000 car per quarter. It‚Äôs just a matter of time before take offüí•üöÄ
"you should make the correction with a perspective. TSLA was also not profitable till a year back. Just 4 quarters of positive EPS. So, NIO shouldnt be that far behind in terms of stock price if you think about the larger picture. The only issue with NIO is that it is a chinese firm hence easy to induce fears in the market by short sellers, nothing more."
holy fuck that's a good price.
Got in at $9 and im still hold till $100
To be honest I think anything under 20 dollars a share is a fucking fire sale. But yes. I have been watching since IPO.
I used the little dip to buy more.
Maybe not worth having these on the weekends
Take it easy ev is the future iand nio will be a big player
ALL I can say is 14 Monday üòé
Its funny how JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs change their price point week to week.
For my long term portfolio i am hoping best for nio üôè
But 13.5$ im hoping to see in short time is for trading purposes
I'm losing a bit of faith can someone hold me and tell me itll be alright :')
I just want it to go back down below 12 so I can average down üò≠
"Elon sees Nio as a genuine threat hence the direct attack on Nio‚Äôs share price by announcing a stock split. It‚Äôs gonna be a hell of a ride but it just means Robinhooders will stay away from Nio‚Äôs stock from now. Sit back and let fundamentals drive this stock up, as it should."
Hoping to see 13.5$  üòÖ
Wtf is the deal with Trump and Tencent ? Is this something we should be concerned with ? Can‚Äôt they seize any assets ?
What is it now?
"Long term on this bitch .. EV is the next big thing and Nio is gonna be up there , cars looking hella sleek , battery swap tech is on point and you know those chinese love their chinese corps .. apple is not the market leader over there and never will be , tesla will never be market leader there Nio will , hold in tight let that money sit for 10-15 years and put your yacht next to mine in Saint-Tropez comme retirement time üòò"
I held two years ago when it went from $13 to $2.4 and got margin called. Sold covered calls all the way down.
"Elon doesn‚Äôt care about NIO.

NIO stock has been riding the coattails of TSLA and be glad for that."
Aim higher

And this is the latest I could find about Sachs.


https://marketrealist.com/2020/06/nio-investors-shouldnt-worry-goldman-sachss-downgrade/

Looking like they're saying they think it should be about $7.0


These guys seem to change their mind a lot. As someone whose followed the company for a while, I understand. Nios had its ups and downs. Im just hoping they will look at it more closely in the future. It seems to be picking up steam in general, and that's great to see."
"Apple is begging USA government to let them use WeChat cause they know no one will buy there crap in China without it. It is funny how Trump targets every successful Chinese company that does Business in USA, but forgets were USA companies makes there stuff. Commies are better in free market capitalism then muricans with their protectionism policies. And NIO is the only other company who makes luxury class EV's en masse for the middle class in China who is way bigger then in  the USA. Potential in there and growth is huge."
Just wait until they have a sedan and can actually compete with tesla head to head. I think that‚Äôs when we‚Äôre going to üöÄ
"Let me just logout of my account and I'll see you in 10 years :,)"
These sell side analysts should be read only for entertainment. You should reference their ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù and PT‚Äôs for TSLA over the years.
"Not only that, communication with the Chinese would be virtually impossible without wechat. Personally i dont think this ban goes through... but if it does, big blow to all American companies operating in China"
Thats kind of the point I was trying to make but I didn't want to sound naive. It really is funny.
"So they are selling an elliptical, stationary bike and a rowing machine? 

Definitely sounds like they are trying to build an entire lifestyle company, not just a car company. I guess this plays into their ‚ÄòNio Home‚Äô concept. 

Exercise equipment is a pretty solid sector to be in actually, Nautilus (Bowflex/Schwinn) stock has been doing super well since everyone is stuck at home and avoiding gyms. If Nio can capitalize on some of that market segment it‚Äôs not a bad idea. 

Mobility solutions + home lifestyle seems like a great combination, as long as they don‚Äôt dilute their brand and keep up quality."
"Interesting the only reason I don‚Äôt have a position is because I wanted to see them branch farther out and create other sources of income, this could potentially change everything"
Could someone provide a translation? Would be appreciated
Just focus on a single thing a brand will form when you make great products people love IE Tesla
They should rather focus on cars honestly
"There is a growing trend to healthy living in China. Fitness, healthy food, and of course better pollution control + green energy. NIO is playing right into all of this and it makes me believe in this company so much more."
So right now we are almost down 2% pre market but this week has taught me not to really trust that. Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt drop below $13 again
Rough morning
big shorting so all the puts are ITM. I think we end up red but maybe down 2-3% instead of the 5% currently
One red day means nothing if we have an equally valued or better green day this week
Learning not to buy options right after ER. Had some 12.5 calls for today i thought were a sure fire. Now I'm thinking I should've just bought calls for January.
"Friday, August 14, 2020"
Anyone have any theories on why it dropped further today? I'm a noob to stocks but I do know this seems like one to hold onto long term because the reward is still a ways off.
So .. with GS latest sec filing showing theh upped 14% and now have a 100.000.000 mill equity stake in this bitch i wonder when they'll up their PT .. also saw that vanguard group purchased a big 200mill chunk of this badboy . Feels like we've been dancing around that 13 mark since that astonishing ER while NKlA is souring off based on hopes and dreams . If this doesn't scream manipulation and bias from WS i don't know what will .
If it drops 12 or less I‚Äôm buying more.
"Same. I'm in at $4.50, sold half at $7, bought more at $11. Holding for the long haul."
Called that pretty well
Too much manipulation man. Who knows which ways it goes after ER
"It looks like people didn't understand that they need to reply to this comment to start the discussion for the day. 

It may need to be made clearer."
"Stocks go up and down bro..

Tesla didnt go from 0 straight to 1600. There were tons of dips."
In the same filing GS had 17m in put options. Probably a PT upgrade after they all expire. Im also intrigued by some of the new investors like renissance who bought 9m shares in q2.
I bought an extra 125 when it was at $12.90 I‚Äôm basically all in on the company but I‚Äôve accepted that this stock might be a slow one
Yeah I feel naive. Here I was thinking absolutely smashing the ER was good for the stock. Now I'm reading more and realizing I'm just a goldfish in the wake of some whales battling it out.
Definitely people out there trying to make the stock look bad
That wasn't actually the reason for this comment. The idea is a new thread every day. I'm currently experimenting with Reddit's post repeat feature.
Thanks. Just wanted to make sure that there isn't something bad going on behind the scenes. I just started investing last month once my brother got into it so I still have a lot to learn.
"It took me a while to just settle down and buy dips, but I'm extremely confident in nio long term. But yeah, could be a slow one"
"It took tesla 10 years to really take off, patience my fellow redditors"
Ha OK my bad !
"Yea on the apps u can check the last 5 years of any stock... check it out, stocks go up and down ALOT."
what's your avg bro?
"Unfortunately I started investing in Revolut and they don't calculate your average, but I'm up 31% as of writing this (236 shares). On Trading 212 I have 92 at an average of $13.48"
"sounds pretty good, I have avg at 14.42, looks like I am not very lucky üò•"
"Not right now, but as long as you're willing to hold for a few months at least, you'll be fine bro"
Thank you!
Thankyou for bringing me aboard! Glad to serve this sub.
Thanks for the hard work!
A lot to clean up in the last couple of months. Good luck!
What are most people holding in this? Anyone gone balls out and spent thousands? Im skeptical and a newbie to stocks and shares- bought 10 shares at $15 and pretty happy so far! But kinda skeptical on the business...
Thanks!
300@13.10 ..refuelling with another 2-300
"10 000 shares at 5$ avg. One of my best investments so far. NIO has better long term prospect then Tesla imo, cause of bigger China market."

"Not sure why this is downvoted, it seems like a better option at this point if moderators in this sub are a problem. At least that sub is open to having better moderation"
centralization seems bad for subs... there should be more mods
Better moderation for them means banning people pointing out that mods aren't leading by example. Great start!
Agreed.
"Ya, Tesla is the Tesla of China.

Tesla = Coke

Nio = Pepsi

Lots of room for upside for both companies but Nio will not be the Tesla of China imo."
"**The Nio Analysts:** Piper Sandler analyst [Alexander Potter ](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/alexander-potter)reiterated a Neutral rating on Nio and¬†increased the price target from $4 to $14.

BofA Securities analyst [Ming Hsun Lee ](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/ming-hsun-lee)reiterated a Buy rating and increased the price target from $17.40 to $18."
i am looking at 32
"**PROS:**

* Trump's Anti-China sentiment is only pushing Chinese consumers towards Made in China products (If you check the numbers, Tesla's Model 3 dropped from July by about 3,000 than June's numbers)
* NIO production is increasing by 25% by Q4 after a tweak to production chain in Q3
* If you read the recent earnings call, the CEO says even his friends can't get an ES8 delivered early so demand is pent up
* NIO is getting the NEV credits that they can re-sell in Q4 to add to their gross margin
* BaaS allows NIO to sell their cars at a much more reasonable price compared to similar-spec EVs at a way better price point (with the economy being in tatters, consumers are only going to flock to NIO due to the bang for buck for what u get)

&#x200B;

**CONS:**

* the NIO CEO acknowledged that their Navigation-on-Pilot was not as advanced as Tesla's.. but I mean if you are selling at 10-25% less than your competitor, that's expected
* Porsche, BMW, Audi are coming out with electric vehicles next year (see BaaS note above as counter-argument)"
I'm keeping mine until Next year
"It doesn't... The Tesla of China is Tesla, now NIO is likely to be their close second.

EDIT: please argue your point if you're going to downvote. 

Tesla is already producing more cars in a week than NIO in a month from Giga Shangai and they actually build them themselves, not a 3rd party partner like NIO with JAG."
"can hit 16 EOY, I am fine then"
"I asked friends of my cousin who live in China, they are middle managers in the apparel industry so they can afford expensive cars. When asked about their opinion about NIO vs LI Auto vs Tesla.

It was unanimous that all idolize Tesla.

It has this aura."
"I think Tesla will probably be the more popular choice , however China‚Äôs urban cities do not support home charging station  (hence why nio went in the direction of battery swapping)"
yup tesla and nio aint competitors. wait for the big boys to show up to play
">Trump's Anti-China sentiment is only pushing Chinese consumers towards Made in China products (If you check the numbers, Tesla's Model 3 dropped from July by about 3,000 than June's numbers)

You can't compare the last month of a quarter with the first one of the following.

First one they redo their inventory and stop to upgrade/tweak the production lines. 

That point is moot, you must not follow Tesla much."
Porsche BMW and Audi are all like 2X more expensive
So not longer than that? For a specific reason?
"Ill bite. I didnt downvote you but would like to discuss this point. Of course Tesla has more sales, more production and demand, they have a decade headstart on NIO. Im just wondering about consumer sentiment. Tesla & Musk is currently quite pro chinese atm so this isnt a big worry. It just takes one slip to completely reverse that. See examples like the NBA last year. They had a major audience in China but one tiny slip from a NBA GM and games were banned and they lose that revenue stream immediately"
In regards to EVs Tesla and NIO are the big boys. The rest of the industry doesn‚Äôt know how to make EVs or nor do they care to
wdym they are direct competitors for ev
"You underestimate how nationalistic the country can become, or already has tbh."
"How is that point moot? How is tweaking production related to Trump's anti-China rhetoric? Are you saying the Trump administration does not have an anti-China policy right now?

Do you think Chinese consumers are blindly just buying Tesla products? People buy their own products.. that's common in every country."
buying a house with it. Fully paid in Irvine area...  Maybe Palo Alto if it hit the high projection.
"Going and assume that a mistake will be made is to really not know what Musk & Tesla have achieved so far and how the relationship there works.

If not for the support on the Giga Texas, Tesla was strongly on its way to be more of a Chinese company than an USAn one tbh. 

The level of support that they got has really no equivalent, they are nearly on par with the support received bu Chinese companies like NIO etc..."
Watch BYD
" `How is tweaking production related to Trump's anti-China rhetoric?` 

It is not and I never said that it was. Read again.

`Are you saying the Trump administration does not have an anti-China policy right now?` 

No, I'm not. I'm saying that it's not what explains the drop.

You claim the drop is due to Trump anti-China policy but Trump is going after China since he got in office. That's part of how he got elected, feeding the racist part of USA with the idea of a new enemy to fight after the russian and the Islam terrorist.

It hasn't impacted Tesla sales in China in the slightest considering the relationship that has been built between Tesla & the chinese government.

Again as I said, the 3k drop is less than a week production from Giga Shangai, that's due to production lines upgrade plus refilling the inventory in shops etc.

Also the biggest policy that could have an impact *in your theory* is a week old or so, it couldn't have impact July sales numbers.

`Do you think Chinese consumers are blindly just buying Tesla products? People buy their own products.. that's common in every country.` 

Tesla demand is sky high everywhere in the world & isn't impacted by the retard's policy. 

People buying Tesla are more wealthy ones (considering the price tag), likely more educated and to have the ability to see the difference between the US government idiots & Elon/Tesla.

Also cars sold by Tesla in China are Made in China so they aren't considered as USAn like you think by the population/government. 

That's why there is an emphasis on the ""MIC"" tag."
Well good for you lol
"I agree the relationship between Tesla and the Chinese govn has been rock solid. Alot of that support came when all the potential chinese competitors were struggling. Now things are a bit different with NIO having a clearer path ahead. Would the chinese govn do the same investment in Tesla if NIO was currently at the same level of success? 

Of course im talking in hypotheticals. Im just saying the Chinese has always loved to support their domestic and home grown products, whatever quality they might be. And it really doesnt take much to completely change the consumer sentiment. Their way of boycotting is a bit more extreme than what we might do here"
Also local sudsidies for Nio  vs Tesla makes a difference.
">Would the chinese govn do the same investment in Tesla if NIO was currently at the same level of success?

No but there aren't so there is no point in speculating about it. NIO isn't going to catch up any time soon (I would even say anyway).

Teslas sold in China are domestic that's why there is an emphasis there on the ""MIC"" tag.

I don't see Tesla being impacted by a boycott of USAn products in China considering that they are domestic and people buying Teslas make the difference between Tesla and the US government."
"Great post. If you want a pump you missed out by over a month at this point. My best advice to anyone impatient (Even i get impatient from time to time) is just not checking the chart. It can be hard but just stop checking it so often, don't panic if you see it down or don't set up high expectations"
"Nioglobal is the advertising sub of a daily YouTuber, none of the recent news are posted by a quick look at it.

Don't waste your time joining it.

EDIT: `You have been permanently banned from participating in r/NIOGlobal. You can still view and subscribe to r/NIOGlobal, but you won't be able to post or comment.`

And this people is what happens when you point out to a moderator that he can't post a link correctly on r/NIOGlobal. What a joke you are u/curvedbymykind!!!"
Textbook consolidation this morning. There‚Äôs going to be a squeeze soon. When it happens this MF‚Äôer is going to blow.
Yeah Courtside Financial does pretty okay videos but half the posts are his links
Great post!
Came here to say the same thing. So obvious.
"Thing is, the moderator recently started adding more mods so the historical posts will not reflect the future posts"
What do you mean
How often do the short positions get updated? Any idea?
"Yeah but if we move quality posts there, it‚Äôll eventually dilute his posts. Plus we can discuss regulations against self promotion."
Same sentiments. Really annoying and nothing new or insight there that this group isn't already providing. We already have a good community here at the original r/Nio. Sure there are some ranting posts but it adds some flavour to the community and I enjoy it. I don't see how this group has lower quality posts. I don't see a need for another NIO group.
"Whatever....There I already an active Nio sub (this one) so nioglobal is useless.

Speculate on the future but how hard can it be for the sub owner to post links of news between his YT videos to make it  appealing, that just show he hasn't and doesn't care much except for doing his advertising. 

Also I think that the guy who created nioglobal wanted control of the sub as he crated it after this one (I remember him posting here about his fantastic new sub months ago), not really reassuring imo.

It's not the first time that you guys are trying to poach members here for your failed sub here. I would be banning you if I was mod here."
"there are a lot of positions shorting the stock currently but after the initial wipe out of weak hands and day trading profit takers have left there will be an influx of buyers to rain in off of the upgraded price targets that have come in, which will in turn push the stock higher and eventually force shorts to fold ‚Äî short squeeze."
"Poach subs? I became mod yesterday after asking him because he‚Äôs very open to having multiple mods and having a better community. I don‚Äôt give a fuck about becoming mod of a subreddit, I just want higher quality posts. 

The mod here seems like he really wants autonomy control since he doesn‚Äôt respond to people suggesting there be more mods. 

Moreover, you sound quite offended at a small suggestion since the mod here doesn‚Äôt do shit, I‚Äôm starting to think you‚Äôre the same guy as the mod lmao. 

You‚Äôre right, the subreddit is active with 90% low quality posts such as ‚Äúshould I sell? Should I buy? What price will it be end of today?‚Äù If that‚Äôs your type of quality that you‚Äôre looking for then feel free to stay 

TLDR: the moderator here doesn‚Äôt want to make anyone mod and doesn‚Äôt do anything about Low quality posts and you are defending that."
"You're a mod on a sub and can't make a readable comment when posting from your phone.

Tips for you: press enter twice at the end of sentences to avoid a block of text when posting on mobile.

I agree that we need more mods here considering the amount of shitposts that we get and I've said it multiple times too. But nioglobal is just an advertising sub for that YouTuber and him letting whoever wants it become moderator just add to the fact that he doesn't care about the sub that he created for advertisement purposes only.

Going back to him not doing anything to make it attractive like posting the news.

TLDR: I hate the lack of moderations here too but I will discourage people to join a sub created by a guy that only cares about his YT popularity (money if he makes any).

EDIT: I went and check the sub again. 2 new posts: one without source and **one from you with a link not posted as a link..**. Are you seriously talking about quality posts?"
Lmao so your solution to the problem is to discourage solutions and keep the problem we have at hand. You realize a new mod could just delete every post on that subreddit and have a fresh start right? It seems you don‚Äôt have any problem solving skills.
"You are part of the problem when I see your last post on your fantastic sub.

What I realize is that having any James be a mod doesn't make for good moderation either.

My problem solving skills are just fine, don't worry I make a living of it.

EDIT:You banned me from your sub while I was replying here. Grow up!"
I know you make a good living from playing that destiny 2 from your moms basement üòò
"You banned me from your sub.

Moderator for 24h and already on a powertrip hahaha.

u/CourtsideFinancial & u/NIOGlobal great moderator that you got yourself."
"Dw bud don‚Äôt be too bummed out. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúmy‚Äù sub but it‚Äôs the sub for real NIO investors with actual input on the stock rather than talking about irrelevant things. I see irrelevant content as something more fitting for this sub, until something is done for this sub at least üòâ"
"You're a kid that got given more power that you should ever get and shown what you do with it. A real piece of shit of a person.

"I have no hate towards you. Remember at the end of the day we are all NIO investors and want good for NIO. No reason to hate or make fun of other investors. I have invested enough in NIO that it made me a millionaire which in turn I have more responsibilities towards my family so no time to manage the subreddit as much. And trust me courtside financial is just someone who posts there frequently, that's it."
"Just tagged you to show you how great your new mod is. 

He's talking about quality posts and he can't post a comment or a link correctly.

You do whatever you want with that info I don't care.

r/NIOGlobal wasn't needed as r/Nio was already big enough when you created it and you just did that to have control on the sub but nothing is happening on it.

It has no value added to this sub despite it being plagued by shitposts. 

**You didn't even post the earning report.** and haven't post from this account on your sub in 2 month. 

My take is that you are u/courtsidefinancial and r/NIOGlobal is useless.

Anyway as I said, do whatever you want regarding your moderator but I would remove his power if I were you."
Oh well I see why you were banned and conversation between us is finished.
Fine by me. Good luck with your inactive sub üòâ
"Based on those potentially low August numbers, do you think a shorts might actually be the correct move here? Assuming like 3k deliveries for August, I'm sure some paper hands would probably sell, and shorts can cover if it drops to around $12 potentially. Not sure if you think we would see it hit that low again, but would welcome any thoughts"
"I think one interesting area to look at is exactly how many vehicles the JAC factories can churn out. From my understand NIO partnered with the government-owned company to manufacture their cars, and the government has an incentive to switch to electric vehicles.  


Will be interesting to see how much capacity shifted from manufacturing JAC vehicles to NIO vehicles."
"The ES6 is actually 358,000 RMB minus 100,000 for the battery, meaning the final sale price is 258,000 RMB. I recently explained this in detail: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i8eir9/nio_is_actually_more_compelling_than_you_think"
The one thing I was expecting to hear from that was the preorder numbers for EC6... Still at least they said demand was higher than expected!
manufacturing in china is easier
"Until the day nio has its own factories plus exporting to north america and europe, dont expect the share price to surge. We have yet to know what the world thinks of nio. And thats where scalability comes in"
Another post that should just be a comment.
"Personally I would expect approx. 3800 in August
Remember they produced 3500 in July despite losing 5 days production. I think they are producing at a rate of approx. 4200 monthly but that number may reduce for the EC6 produced but not delivered. Also remember the capacity increase to 4500 to 5000 in late August / early September.
I am pretty sure this management knows how to handle expectations after the initial missteps"
"Thanks for reference to your excellent post. Please explain why August numbers will smash expectations. In August some of the production vehicles will be EC6 vehicles which will be delivered in September. So I was thinking the August numbers would be a little lower maybe 3700 to 3800 allowing for about 400 EC6 produced & not reported. 
Also I was not aware of the Govt. Credit & the different was Tesla & NIO treated this. Is there any link where I can learn more about that. THANKS"
Just china is sufficient for them
Thanks. Just trying to find some reason with the relentless shorting thats been going on
"Just china is bad, at least they're expanding into europe next year"
Arent convertible bond holders simply cashing out? Its like 3-4x return based on current stock price.
"Might be a case of traders just being traders. They'll short till everyone's stop-losses triggers and then swoop them back up at a much cheaper price. Given the kind of volume they can trade - it's a lot of easy money for them applying pressure on a stock that doesn't have a solid base on buyers just yet. Think most funds, other than hedge funds, won't be allowed to put money in such high-risk companies although I think it's getting less high-risk as we speak. I'd think the big money will flow in once the traditional funds stop seeing NIO as a high-risk investment but a good growth play."
It is but the enormity of China is mostly misunderstood. They can go whereever they want but they need to be able to prove to the Chinese market that they are good.
There are tons of funds with NIO included. Have you looked at the institutional investors. ? Vanguard. Morgan Stanley. J.P. Morgan. Loads more.
"If we want nio shares to 10x, it needs to be global. Look at chinese stocks listed in the US, which only have a significant presence in the mainland, their share price are stagnant."
"Step 1 BaaS goes global
Step 2 Infra setup complete
Step 3 Global launch

Not easy to just go global...you need the infra in place."
"Obviously. Speaking of which, im not really a fan of baas. I wish nio wouldnt have gone this route. Long term capital intensive + logistical nightmare > short term cost saving"
"Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. If there‚Äôs a high amount of short-sellers, stocks MAY have difficulty of growing? I see that people are stating that there are too many people selling their shares from (for example) $8 at $14. Because if that‚Äôs the case... then it‚Äôs confirmed because there were a LOT more short-sellers before than what you see here *cough* $14 highs."
"Unlikely this is short selling causing the drop. It is more likely that weak longs and high open interest OTM calls are selling, causing delta hedging. Until these folks clear out, every pop is sold off."
A short squeeze could happen soon hopefully
"Short selling refers to those who borrow stock and aim to capitalize off of falling stock prices. They aim to borrow shares, sell those shares at a given rate and then buy the shares back to return to the lender. The money made is from selling high/buying low. 
  
Someone who bought shares of Nio at $8 or less a few months ago and sold in the past week at $14 or $15 wouldn‚Äôt be a short seller. Any profits taken from such sales would fall under short term capital gains (assuming, again, that they have held the stock for months as opposed to years). 
  
Both groups have likely contributed to recent changes in stock price. Not everyone is going to hold long in anticipation of greater gains and lower tax rates. Some are happy to sell and take gains as a stock is pricing/correcting rather than risk a further drop. That‚Äôs especially true when there are many who bought into Nio at <$10 a share. Doesn‚Äôt mean some of them won‚Äôt buy back in.
  
There‚Äôs a lot that goes into it, but earnings periods can seem counter-intuitive because there are different kinds of shareholders with different mentalities/strategies/goals, which means good news doesn‚Äôt always result in immediate, sustainable increase in stock price. Likewise, bad news doesn‚Äôt always result in the opposite. Give it time. Good news on deliveries, BaaS developments, etc could all factor into further adjustments in stock price over the next month or two. People circle earnings like vultures, and you can make a lot of money that way. But it‚Äôs also possible to capitalize on all of the action in between. And if you‚Äôre long on the stock, understand that these periods of volatility will happen, especially with a young, growing company like Nio. It can be hard not to obsess about near term stock volatility (especially of the negative variety) when you anticipate long-term growth, but there‚Äôs really no reason to panic."
"do you think it is likely in NIO's case? I mean there is no further positive catalyst for the stock to get on a rally to trigger the short squeeze in short term, unless they come with good Aug delivery numbers."
Thank you for sharing this.
"It would have to be good news on August delivery numbers, so if a short squeeze does occur it will be in a month or so. This could mean that the rest of this month could be bearish"
"It has likely already been posted as a lot of people talked about it.

You should avoid posting amp links."
It will by Friday when people get paid
"For fucks sake, stop setting short term expectations. Have better quality in your posts, not ‚ÄúI HOPE STOCK STOCK REACHES (price) TODAY‚Äù. Then if it doesn‚Äôt every post in the subreddit is going to be ‚Äúwhat happened? Why didn‚Äôt it reach (price) today?‚Äù

Learn to set long term expectations. You can‚Äôt predict what happens in the short term. If you want to predict short term fluctuations go to the day trader sub."
"I see Tesla is up 7% in pre-market, lets hope nio can ride those gains to tendie town"
I plan on buying another 100 shares if it carries on dipping today
"I wouldn‚Äôt out tons of pressure on short term upward price movement. Honestly I think if we can stay in the 12-13 mark and build a base, we‚Äôll be well set up for the next leg up. There‚Äôs still plenty of potential catalysts for this stock. They could announce plans for their own factory, pre orders on EC6. Well have August deliveries in a few weeks, etc. NIO has had stellar price growth over the summer and I think these levels are super healthy. My average is about 11.50 now, not counting the covered calls I‚Äôve sold. If you don‚Äôt mind potentially having to deliver your share, selling calls can really help get your price average down to a level that makes it a lot more comfortable holding during these little dips"
Smh still mad about my calls... i thought it was a layup.....smh i threw the ball into the stands.üò´
"It's going to stay in this area for a while.. it's been fighting to break out but gets pulled back. I suspect the massive sell off where big names keeping this down and cashing out as well.

People seem to forget that this just finished a 200+% rally"
"Welp, its up .29 cent pre market"
"Funny, the Gordon Gecko of reddit lambasting me over getting my stock news from reddit, also participating in a conversation on said subreddit. Last I heard, the construction trade provides more than adequate cash flow to invest in the stock market. Ok? DJQuarantineZoomMeeting"
"People that rely on weekly paychecks to be able to invest shouldn‚Äôt be investing in a high risk company such as NIO...  christ. 

This is why financial literacy should be mandatory in high school."
This didn‚Äôt age well :(
Agreed. Seems like there is a sudden influx of new investors with a get rich quick mentality
"This is legit AMD 2.0, mods need to clean up these threads and make a  stickied discussion thread at the top."
"It‚Äôs up because they announced split, wouldn‚Äôt really impact NIO."
Lmao ikr. What calls do u have?!
"I‚Äôm sorry, not everyone is able to just use daddy‚Äôs allowance money to make adult investments unlike the fucking DJ over here. Last time I checked, people can invest their own money however the fuck they want. And speaking of financial literacy, typical high risk investments are normal for young adults early in their careers unlike those on the opposite end of the spectrum who are a few years away from retirement.

Smart ass."
"Moderation is fucking weak as shit in this sub

Might be time to go to r/Nioglobal"
"Honestly young adults can afford to invest in riskier stocks, but for someone that's living paycheck to paycheck, it would be a much better idea to invest in something stable such as PEP, JNJ and MMM. These blue chip stocks tend to outperform the stock market and are better moves in the long run, with minimal risk of loss. 

Again, it's your money, so it's your decision, but people shouldn't be gambling in the stock market like people are doing more and more (especially with the increase in Robinhood investors)"
"Apologizes and proceeds to throw slurs and insults. 


Typical reddit mentality, if someone else is well off, it is 100% daddy‚Äôs money and nothing else. Salty much? 


Sure people can invest any way they want that‚Äôs why my comment was a suggestion, not an order. Since you can‚Äôt comprehend basic English syntax and grammar, I understand you had a hard time interpreting it. 


High risk investments are normal for people with decent financial cushion and stable cash flow, not for burger flipping retards like yourself who get their stock news from other nitwits in this subreddit. Idiot, check your sources.


Just as I suspected, seems like you‚Äôre a complete noob at the stock market judging from your previous comments, specifically this one ‚Äúive been trying to understand stock market for a year‚Äù.


Take a seat you pleb, I‚Äôve been doing this for 7 years."
"Nice, didn't know about that sub. It's actually organized there but it looks like someone is trying to pump that YouTuber, Courtside Financial."
"You can not be living paycheck to paycheck and still be waiting for payday or bonuses to invest in the stock market because the rest of your money is tied up in investments. Also, the 3 companies you named are all being outperformed by every major indexes."
"I know its a old post but I add 2k of bi-weekly pay to the stock market twice a month, have been doing it for the last five years (With 1k the first two years) does it make me a pleb?"
That‚Äôs him plugging his own YouTube but his content is actually decent. Id rather have a mix of good quality statistic backed posts/DDs/YouTube reviews than a sub that is 90% retarded posts like this though.
"Including dividends (which does count), those 3 companies outperform almost every index for long term investing.
Also, my point was that this isn't a stock to invest in if someone with a low income is hoping to make some money, because it is very high risk. 

Just because you invested in a company doesn't have to make you completely biased. NIO is a high risk investment."
"You should take your own advice if you invested in those 3 companies 5 years ago you would have made those percentage (dividend included) JNJ (11.54%) - Pep (10.03) - MMM (4.28%). Meanwhile those new investors could get SPY (11.98%) and QQQ (20.8%)  while doing a much safer investment. I am not advocating for NIO, just saying that the 3 companies you named are a high risk as they might be the next in line to follow ford and ge in the boomer abbyss."
"Ya if you‚Äôre new to NIO, it‚Äôs going to be a long but rewarding process just Tesla. Short shorts everywhere"
"The more short sellers we have the better. They are in the loosing side and sooner or later we will start having short squeezes that can push NIO stock price up very fast. But what really surprises me are the shorts boldness to short NIO on very good ER, when upgrades are coming. NIO short are really dedicated bunch of idiots."
I agree that they are controlling the stock lately. I thought that we could see some covering today but I was completely off base. The shorting begins at approx the same time daily. How much time does someone have to buy to cover ?  Days ? Weeks ? I‚Äôm a new investor trying to gain some insight.
"I am a bit late to the scene for NIO stock, which means instead of the being a true long I have to trade the stock instead, and somehow it turns out to be hugely profitable so I am kinda thankful for the shorts, GLTA."
"I am not an expert on shorting. But even if the number of shares shorted goes up, how does that lead to the price tanking today with such a positive earnings."
üíØSellers should have hold onto their shares when ER occurs to allow the value to grow
We were both off base. I think there are no time constraints to how long they can keep a short position. Of course they have to pay to borrow the shares plus they get margin calls if the stock goes up. Given the NIO share price most of the Shorts are losing money & stand to potentially lose a lot more.
"Just adding my two cents worth here. The amount of shorts is basically 27% of the total volume on 11th Aug. This addition 27% of the volume is on top of those who actually own the shares and are selling (not shortists but actual stock owners).  


When you borrow the shares to short, it still goes into the bid and ask queue. Shortists basically add a lot of selling pressure to the stock and I read some comments saying that it triggered a lot of stop-losses which caused even more selling. I guess it just so happens that a lot of people want to sell when the price has reached a short-term peak."
If you have a 50 million share seller (sure there is a pack of them acting in unison like a pack of hyenas) -- he WILL control the price movement of a stock that trades 174 million shares. He will drive stock down rapidly in short burst to create panic selling
Who really sells on good ER? People should really start distinguishing manipulation and not give up.
">The NIO Shorts cannot manipulate the stock forever. 4 out of the last 5 days 28% of the total volume has been from new NIO Shorts. Ultimately the fundamentals of the company will prevail. Proud to be long & strong based on fundamentals NOT influenced by manipulation from the Shorts trying to make the stock look bad

Could I ask if short-sellers are using CFDs or are doing actual borrowing and short-selling? I believe CFDs have financial costs per annum (at least that's why my broker does). They charge a percentage of the contract value per year. There's also a roll-over, meaning all CFD contracts will be closed after a month and renewed based on the new prices.  


Do borrowers need to pay financing costs if they borrow to short-sell?"
I am sure brokerage houses must charge fees for lending shares
Ban
make no sense

This price volatility is absolutely normal on days with hot news. We are still holding bags full of gold.
‚ÄúShut up and hodl‚Äù
"Hold. It‚Äôs not just NIO that is getting the drop so it‚Äôs not a NIO problem. (I‚Äôm a noob but cheap) Besides, if you just bought the stocks within 3 months with no large loss (depending how much a loss is big to you... 10%, 15%, ect), then it‚Äôs too early to pull out. 


Tbh, if it wasn‚Äôt for that drop that affected a lot of other companies, NIO would of been way above $15. I would trust NIO."
Never think about actions you didn't do. You cant know the future
Thanks (:
Where the diamond hands at
"Sucks that the market responds this way, but from a purely fundemental perspective, they literally blew it out of the water. This will eventually be reflected in the stock price, just gotta be patient. Diamond hands with you buddy"
"Almost made a post like this, thank you. Its confusing but after seeing this happen with tesla in the past couple years im not surprised. See you on the moon base my diamond handed brethren."
"The paper hands will regret this day, they panic sold when they didn‚Äôt see it go up after open not realising that news like this takes hours sometimes a day to trickle through. Interesting to see how Goldman‚Äôs rating changes now they can actually forecast a profit at some point."
Q3 sounds like under promise and over-deliver strategy.
Buy the dip and diamond hand forever
I cashed out all 38800 shares I had at $15.3 right at the off. At the moment Chinese stock is just not the favour of the month. I am looking to buy it all back at $11.50-12.50. GLTA.
Hopefully NIO will underperform in Q3 so that the share price will skyrocket. That's how it works right?
Just bought more.
What the fuck happened
Nice post OP! I think will be up close to $20 after Aug numbers.. they need to hit 4k avg per month to meet q3 numbers.. I think they will get it done.
"When the outlook and Q2 earnings for NIO was expected to be negative, yet turns out positive...GS bears and the followers will be pissed. Will rally. Will fail. NIO will be $20 by next week if not earlier. Drops mic"
Wait til they get their gains tax for repeatedly selling on a dime. Then they‚Äôll learn
Buy the dip! Earning numbers were great. Only matter time we‚Äôll make to new highs
Haha buying go brrrrrr
Rip
Holllllaaaaa
Without paper hands there wouldn't be good opportunities to buy more.
"Yeah, you got lucky. I was hoping for second wave that never come. Oh well as long as nio keeps performing brilliantly there is no fear."
Fair play dude!
What if it doesn't drop that low or you chicken out and don't buy back in? Then what?
It worked on Wkhs.
Yes
Smart!
They will get it done with government buying for police vehicles etc. but not sure they could do it consistently by themselves.
"Look I had a harsh lesson last month when the stock was at $16, I could have cleared over 100k in profit but I didn't sell fast enough and only got less than half. I was listening to the whole Q&A portion of the earnings call and after the question of autonomous driving and upping productions I realized it is time to sell. Now it is a matter of when will the analysts upgrade the stock, lets see if it will drop further this week so I will start buying."
I sold my SLV position last Friday to buy the last 8800 shares which means when I sold today I was 100% out of the market. That was the real lucky part.
With NIO you can always get back in. It is just how it is.
"Im long and have about 10k at 5.1 usd avg. But its funny to see that Nicola and Nio has the same market cap. Nio shouldn't go bellow 12, only if market tanks hard. IMO people just too shaky when it comes to Chinese stocks and it js easy to manipulate. But long term is solid and sooner or later we will see 20-25."
"I hate you. Literally the inverse. Gold and slv destroyed me massively.

Good on you pal enjoy the profits!"
Many people sold at $10. They haven't gotten back in. Then what?
"If I have $5.1 cost I wouldn't touch them either. I am prepared to start buying at $12.5, lets see where will it lands."
"Hold on to your SLV, you will see a profit soon."
"Thats their business, nothing to do with me."
My point is they had the same strategy as you but it never materialized. Then what?
Their failure to execute has nothing to do with me. It is their money and they can do whatever they want.
It has nothing to do with execution. There's nothing you can do to make the price drop back to the range you want it to be at. Then what?
I managed it just fine so I don't know what you are talking about.  You do know there are loads of short sellers for NIO right??
Manage what fine? You cant force a stock to move to the price you want. Then what?
I wait. If you can't stay calm you will not make any money in the stock market.
"""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."" - **Warren Buffett**."
"Amen brother. That dude kept asking ""Then what?""  seems impatient. I hope he hasn't lost all his money."
What if you wait and it never comes? Then what?
"It dropped to $12.67 earlier, I think I can get $12.5 next week for sure. But Q3 might not be great for NIO. Q4 will be much better."
What if it never drops to that price? Then what?
"Come back next week, we will see."
What happens if it doesn't drop by next week? Then what?
"Ask me next week.

Did you make some money today?  It's free money everywhere lol."
What happens if it doesn't reach your price next week? Then what?
Source? Otherwise that just a shit post.
"It could be, NIO had low volume trading for a long while. The large amount from JPMorgan could have easily triggered all the stop losses and panic sellers"
"If you could find the time of the sell, we could very easily find out why the selloff started."
"DavidNIO on yahoo NIO forum posted it. I checked their Aug 11 SEC filing and they did indeed sell off massive shares and have put/call purchases, but I didn't find the actual sale date since it said as of Aug 30  [https://fintel.io/i13f/jpmorgan-chase-/2020-06-30-0](https://fintel.io/i13f/jpmorgan-chase-/2020-06-30-0)"
"It looks like it was during the previous quarter ""as of June 30th"" therefore unrelated to this week drop that was due to Trump BS imho."
"It's probably a combination. 

&#x200B;

From Yahoo

1. $100M bonds maturing
2. Early and mid adopters cashing in on earnings
3. Recent winners cashing in
4. Large player shorts piling on to create mo
5. China effect (Luckin, WeCat, Senate bill, etc)
6. Panic selling
7. Stop loss triggers"
"Ive seen this game before with AMD. When share price is low, short sellers and institutional hedge fund can easily manipulate stock price. Patience is the key. Nio has like 15% shares short, AMD back in the days had like 20% short. Short sellers will be forced to cover sooner or later."
Wondering this as well.  Personal speculation is today‚Äôs price was held down by institutions to load up more shares at a discount
"It really doesn't make sense to me, considering NIO wasn't just up massively in premarket NYSE, it had actually been up by about 8% all day on the Frankfurt exchange. Both dropped immediately on the NYSE opening. Frankfurt didn't actually drop when the Q2 came out until it saw NYSE dropping then followed suit."
"People in general took their money and locked it.  I have NIO and should have done the same.  The markets are volitile, people are less prone to wait it out i guess.  Now dont be suprised if it shoots back up by end of week.  I may reduce my position and go into tesla with some of it to take advantage of the split and gain kn the lower price buy in.  

At least that is my thinking."
"Exactly, it's gonna be like this for a few quarters or even years. I rode the AMD game for a few years from $13 to $80. Get strapped up because it's gonna be a long ride."
It'll be interesting to see who the short-sellers are and whether they come from funds or retail investors.
"Pretty new to trading but would be very impressed if retail traders had the means to short this with such vigor, it seemed like it was raining bricks.  180 million in trading volume as well with bearish sentiment despite bullish news- something is off imo"
"Yea you got a point. I have no idea how many people are out there paying attention to this stock though, but I'm assuming it'll be getting global attention. Not just in the US but in mainland China too."
"It's dropping because of Trump and delisting FUD/fuss.

That idiot tries everything he can to make everyone look away that he's killing thousands of USAn by his incompetence"
I was thinking the short sellers caused a cascading effect which in turn triggered multiple levels of stop losses. What do you think?
"This is the real answer: RH traders were bagholding this stock since the last multiday runner in July. They bought in at 15-16, including me, which is why they see this as an opportunity to leave the stock. Now that they‚Äôre gone, we finally can break past the 16 dollar barrier"
"The IV% on the options was sky high. The stock had to move dramatically higher or those options would start to lose value quickly. And so when natural profit taking started this morning, the selling of the options ended up causing substantial delta hedge flow... and then the selling begat more selling and weak longs exited. If there was enough enthusiasm for the stock, that action could be countered.. but that demand was not sufficient."
"100% exactly as [$NET](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-NET/)

Lots of hype. Great earning report. No bad news. But it keeps on crashing because people selling at the all time high.

Every resistance gets broken, it snowballs lower and lower and people starts to panic

$NET 

41 -> 45+ (earning report) > 40 (eod day 1) > 36 (eod day 2) -> now slowly growing again

$NIO

13.3 -> 15+ (earning report)-> 13.1 (eod day 1) -> ??

It's hard to tell what will happen today

TSLA is rising a lot (1->4 stock split) so it might follow up. Or it keeps crashing down to 12-12.50 before growing up again"
"The real ones are still in profit by a mile... this stuff happens a lot, always rises after once people remember it‚Äôs a good company with solid fundamentals"
"What would be your response to the unaudited financials and auditors as a whole? 

I‚Äôm a believer in the company long term but that is my biggest concern at the moment. I don‚Äôt think all American companies are saints nor all Chinese companies are scams but I‚Äôm concerned about pricewaterhouse Cooper Zhong Tiang. 

Disclosure: holding NIO for the long term."
"The anti China propaganda is hurting all Chinese stocks ie BABA, Tencent and especially smaller ones like NIO just recently we had Luckin which does not help.  Just gonna have to prove them wrong...."
Why is no-one drawing attention to the disappointing guidance? It fell because 11-11.5k in Q3 is simply not going to meet Wallstreet's expectations. Until they announce concrete plans to increase production capacity significantly SP is dead in the water.
True a lot of people would of been happy to get out even because of that news
"That‚Äôs my main theory, you see short sellers would of made $2 per share at open either way, the pre market was too good for them ( or at least the majority) to resist. As you said this causes others to sell, then people with stop losses sell and others who fear losing everything. Add in the Chinese Donald trump skeptics who think every Chinese company will be delisted, plus the general tech sell off today and this is what happens. Couldn‚Äôt of been predicted to be fair and NIO is 100% worth more, but time will heal strong"
Possibly that and people almost always sell the news/earning reports no matter if it is good or bad.
"Yeah same thing happened with Tesla at $1000, until the resistance was broken and it ended up flying up to unprecedented levels. Now it‚Äôs stuck again around 1500."
Increased capacity is being addressed and will show more in q4. It won‚Äôt be ready until Sept.
the whole nasdaq is down. its unbelievable.
"crazy gross margin development, they underpromised and overdelivered, the shareprice will pop today"
Don‚Äôt any of you fuckers sleep!!  This is great news and as I‚Äôve been thinking.  This is enough to squeeze the shorts quite a bit as the stock clearly isn‚Äôt on its way down.
They fucking did it guys
Yeeeeeehaw
LOL at Goldman Sach's $7 price target.
"Quarterly Total Revenues reached RMB3,718.9 million (US$526.4 million)¬†i
Quarterly Deliveries of the ES8 and the ES6 were 10,331 vehicles
Quarterly Vehicle Margin reached 9.7%

What happened to all the hype üòï I feel like it‚Äôs going to bounce around all day in 14-14.80s
They had their earnings release already?
"How do we know they aren't cooking their numbers?
Real question, I'm a shareholder. Just trying to avoid a Luckin coffee case"
"Can we reach to $20 today??? üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Edit:$15.40 already!!!!
Update: $15.80!!!
I can‚Äôt fall asleeeeeeep"
If Li says one thing on this call today I want it to be that they will comply with all SEC audit requirements.
15.40
Wtf is nio surging. I just don‚Äôt get it and I don‚Äôt believe in market hypothesis here. I believe in the long run but for sure expected a boom now.
What is happening to the stock price? it was over 10% in PM
Lol this is why you buy hype and sell news
An important lesson was learned today in why not to try and play earnings calls.
Buying 100 more shares at 13:26
Been holding it since early July. It‚Äôs all worth it now!
"Noob Question here, very noob question... So would I still have some to buy more shares at its current price the second market opens? Or will premarket push it way up as soon as it opens?"
"Current ratio doubled due to the significant injection of cash from their strategic investors. 

""Substantial completion of cash injections into NIO China"", specifically for the first two installments (RMB 5 Billion) so far

&#x200B;

Current Ratio for Q2 2020 = 1.15

Current Ratio for Q1 2020 = 0.53"
WHAT THE
"This report is fantastic. Congratulations to them. Really looking forward to the next couple of quarters, especially q4 which is historically their highest deliveries. If they can sustain, grow these margins and continously report record sales, theres no stopping this freight train"
I thought they were reporting 8am EDT?
Anyone plan o selling some shares then buying back assuming it pulls backs a little?
Anyone know the current pre market price?
$15
Shout out to the short sellers. Im holding until it hits it big!
Already over 15 now!

Market manipulation
"BRO I picked up shares at $11.60 I saw it go down to $10.80 an hour after opening that day and I was like FUCK I couldn't get in at $10.80 I'm a piece of shit your a piece of shit, like fuck me for life you know? Then now it's at $15 in the PM now. I couldn't even fucking buy because the transfer time it takes from questrade is like 3 days and I wanted to wait til monday to buy more. I could have bought using my bank since I had the funds right there but I didn't want to eat the conversion cost to usd.

&#x200B;

Moral of the story: Buy when everyone is selling and fuck green days :/

EDIT: I ate the conversion cost and bought $1k more from my bank @ $13.99 US/share before close yesterday. Better than nothing :/ Here's to hoping theres another red day"
They‚Äôre probably going to raise it next week because of this news
"And, positive cash flow from operations."
Nio stock should be at least $40 because a scam company like Nikola is around $40 selling nothing. Nikola's q2 revenue was around $33k from doing some solar shit while Nio made over $500 mil with a positive gross margin. Honestly the stock price of Nio and Nikola should just swap.
"Yeah, from the link:

""Quarterly Total Revenues reached RMB3,718.9 million (US$526.4 million)¬†i
Quarterly Deliveries of the ES8 and the ES6 were 10,331 vehicles
Quarterly Vehicle Margin reached 9.7%
Quarterly Gross Margin reached 8.4%""

That is really really good!!"
"We need to wait for audit, but there's so much focus after Luckin, and CEO is always upfront about numbers, I honestly can't see them cooking it up on the back of government and bank loans promised last month."
"They‚Äôre audited by PwC China who have a pretty good record. That‚Äôs about the most assurance you can get, but nothing is 100%, not even a German payment processing company audited by EY."
"You can cross reference Nio's sales with China's car insurance reports. Each month China publishes how many of what brand and what model got newly insured, so they can't blatantly lie about deliveries 50,000 cars, when only 4,000 got insured.  They do get audited by a US firm once a year."
Just wait for audit. I can‚Äôt tell you that they wouldn‚Äôt be stupid enough to cook their numbers after wirecard and luckin scandals and US auditing security is at an all time high for international companies.
This aged well
I bet we see 18-19 by mid day
Idk man I feel like we should have at least broke 16 by now. This makes no sense.
"Ouch. I was so excited too, then it fell like Gandalf."
"You can always put in an order, but depending on if there is any open orders on sellers, you could be lucky, but you might also buy at the top..

Depending on the platform you use, you could put a max buy price of 14.7 or something like that?"
Id say immediately after good earnings report is a bad time to buy.
I've been telling everyone that $11 a share after goldman downgrade was a steal. $13 wasn't shabby either. Money was to be made.
">buy price of 14.7 or something like that?

its not going under 15 today lmfao. you shoulve bought after the gs downgrade like the rest of us plebs did"
CHOOO CHOOO MOTHERFUCKER üöÑüöÑüöÑ‚òÑÔ∏è‚òÑÔ∏è GET ON WHILE YOU STILL CAN
I guess that is when they have the call. They released the report earlier
Too much fomo for me.. Imagine if it never falls back.. Would never forgive myself
"Yes, +10% ."
You were on the loosing side past few months. So congrats on one small victory i guess. Post me when you get margin calls sooner or later

how when the market is closed lol
google.com
"There will 100% be a sell off straight away, all the shorts taking their profits. But should still rise higher as the day goes."
"NIO and NKLA are currently valued at roughly the same, 16 bn market cap.   Which is ridiculous obviously as NKLA should not be anywhere near NIO."
Damn! These numbers are pretty good! And just think about it - this is just the beginning for $NIO.
üò•
I remember when NKLA moon fking hard from $30 to $80 in hours.
Yep should have bought last week
This aged well.
NIO is TESLA 2.0.
Happened to me when it reached $12. Better buying calls to ride the wave.
why the F did it just drop 10 %
I just bought $2k more in shares in the PM. Wish me luck boyz
"They still lost $121 million this Quarter, its not going to even hit 20 by the end of the week."
I wish :(

I would love to see a bit more quality in this sub"
NIO has more than double the outstanding shares.
True. But nio isn‚Äôt all hype haha. Good investors with stable foundation
"Same happened with Astrazeneza after they announced positive Covid-19 vaccine test results. It dropped almost 10% in the following days, because long-time holders were selling the good news at all time high. But we all know that AZN is a giant and good for the long run.

Same with NIO and basically every stock. Remember that NIO is most likely going to deliver good results in Q3 and Q4 2020 as well. More and more people will join the party. They call it ‚ÄûThe Tesla of China‚Äú, but it‚Äòs just NIO and NIO is doing it‚Äòs business. Battery swapping is not something that the rivals have implemented as good as NIO. 
NIO is one step ahead and even if they don‚Äòt conquer USA instantly, they‚Äòll surely do it in Europe, where a little shitty BMW i3 costs the same price as a premium NIO suv... And later in the US as well."

Ok? And? Look at nio and nkla on any finance website... Start with Google... And you'll see the market cap is within a fraction of each other
Nio also has more dillution due to capital raises.
"Yes, NIO has products, sales, logistics and infrastructure. Not even comparable with NKLA."
It will be the new HYPE
should not drop lower than it was yesterday.. this makes no sense
"So to clarify, you mean people are selling because due to the news and capitalising on the price increase?"
"Nope I'm not that guy. I have over 20 shares of Tesla cost basis under $300.  I do also have 800 shares of Nio, so don't think I'm here to bash and short this. I'm just saying you're too excited."
Did it hit 20 yet?
Everyone is learning.
"If they are using platforms that doesn't support pre/after market, I could imagine you wouldn't be aware. If you have the data there, why would you look it up on google/yahoo?"
"Just to let you know, shorting a stock means you are borrowing shares and immediately selling them, hoping to buy them back at a lower price, before returning them to the lender, and take the defference.

It's a common misconception that shorting a stock means buying a stock and selling it in a short period of time."
You‚Äôre clueless on how a short squeeze works dude
Shorties are clearly not ahead. They are forced to cover (buy shares) and that drives the price higher.
"exacly, the fact that it reached -1% means they are selling at a lower amount than it was before the news."
"800 shares? Damn.. I was about to jump on the wagon and get 60 shares but I'm on the fence.. if I drops more before Sept, and the delisting blows over, this really could take off. Waiting a few weeks is killing me. (And yes, I'm not a high roller, yet!)"
Are you planning to hold both of them long-run?
Any minute now
[deleted]
"Whoops, that's what I actually thought haha"
"Everything is definitely looking positive. Pretty impressive, extremely excited to see what 2021 brings! üôå"
The exact opposite of a shitpost
"Nice work. I think you've a typo in relation to the new Nio Houses, you quote two separate figures"
"Another important notes from the Q&A

* Nio plans to sell regulatory credits in Q3 about 113 million RMB, so extra free money for them next quarter.
* Nio looking into and preparing for expansion in other markets, but not expected to enter any in 2020."
Anyone know why the shares took such a hit this morning? Is it because there was a massive sell off?
Did they say how they are going to increase production deliveries? Any news about new factory? Any info on when beautiful ET7 sedan will start production? Thanks for this post.  üöÄ üöÄ
Is BaaS going to be a completely separate company? Or will it still roll into NIO? As an investor I wouldn‚Äôt want to see those revenues go else where.
"I'm guessing a lot of people just taking the profits, I almost did the same myself but decided to hold."
There is room to increase production in the current JAC plant. Will be looking to start up 2nd factory soon. Production for ET7 potentially next year but ceo gave no hard dates
"Nah. BaaS will stay within NIO

Edit: whoops i spoke too soon. Seems like it could potentially be a different company. Not many details here but NIO would be a stakeholder"
"Probably people cashing in on profits. Not worried about it, earnings reinforce the long term potential which is what I invested for anyway."
"People taking profits.... more than 30 milion shares sold, it is gonna go up to 20 EOW"
Buy the dip. I fucked up I thought the dip would be at 14.
"I assume people wanted to take profits then it all started crashing due to low volume. Seems dumb but this one day might delay a pump for a while.

&#x200B;

Still earnings made me be more confident in this company then ever"
weak hands from 3 weeks ago wanting out.
"Every earnings day for decent figures have ended in the red - Apple , Microsoft and Tesla over the last few weeks , in saying that though they weren‚Äôt up 7% pre market like nio was before . I was surprised that big of a dump, Robinhood traders going broganoff"
Bought like 10 more shares though. Really confusing. They just smashed earnings.. Thought it would be a bit more exciting. I guess Wall Street isn't buying it lol
This wasn‚Äôt weak hands. It was institutional investors. Almost every industry saw a drastic sell off all at once
Great news! Buy more!
"No one has any idea what the stock will do. If they are dead certain they know, they don't know shit."
"People just selling the news, it is fairly standard. Though if it gets beaten like a rabid dog, it is going to bounce back."
"The market is was overbought, many traders and investors are rotating out of technology back into re-opening plays. That area of the market still has room to catch up. Also Tesla has been declining there is direct correlation between NIO and Tesla most days."
"Ruining my calls for next week, fuck!"
Tech sell off and profit shorters
this sub is so funny
Look at Tesla. It is what it is. It happens more than you think.
"Lots of things, my guess is a lot of OTM calls that expected a better beat and wouldn‚Äôt make it so they cut their losses"
"Only reason is Trump and his delisting BS.

Are people even following the news? It was posted earlier on the sub... 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/i7o9bb/trump_administration_seeks_to_delist_uslisted/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"
"this makes no sense, its -2%. People are cashing on LOSSES right now"
end of week? how can you be so sure?
Haha I also got trapped
I thought the dip was 15.50 -\_-. Brought my average up quite a bit. I'll probably buy more if it goes lower
Me too buddy. Me too.
Volume is off the charts today
"But yea, more confident as well"
All I can say is fuck
Apple didn't end in the red. Went from 384 to to 425.
This is exactly correct. You cannot time the markets!
Trying to make more on options to buy more shares
How come?
"Just bought more at 13.65, its an opportunity."
"It makes perfect sense. Some people bought in at single digit and usually after earnings people dump their shares for a quick profit. In addition, some people fear it might become Luckin Coffee 2.0, cooking the books due to earnings was un-audited. No one really knows or can predict what's gonna happen. There is also a lot of fear of market crashing again similar to what happened in March, so people are cashing out. A lot of companies share prices tank after ER despite positive earnings or good guidance."
"It was originally cash profits at open, now people are panicking imo."
"Not definitely sure about the EOW, but I believe that it can hit 20 EOW and if it wouldnt hit EOW than EOM and so on"
I am just watching them. I am just going to hold and not bother to trade.
"I second that, fuck"
every single quarterly reports in the history of quarterly reports are unaudited. NIO is in accordance with PCAOB and is being audited by PWC (a big 4 accounting firm) in their annual reports
It does make perfect sense.   People have pop corn brains and haven't gotten their daily dose of dopamine.
"It‚Äôs a reality-check that a significant number of investors, particularly on the retail side, are looking at NIO to turn a quick profit over a long-term investment.

It‚Äôs arguably foolish to try and play a earnings call for this very reason."
"Again like I said people fear it's gonna be Luckin Coffee 2.0 along with the fear of being delisted, US & China political tension."
"This sub reminds me a lot of amd_stock back when it was stuck in the low teens. Stay strong, this will multiple 400% in a few years!"
I took 10$ puts yesterday to cover me against Trump retardness or an eventual bad earnings report. 60$ insurance imo.
"I dream on having one of those cars, no one get my stocks! it's mine!"
"Same, I held on to AMD forever. I remember each earnings was positive but the stock price would tank and recover after. Each quarter had the same pattern since AMD was shorted like crazy back in the day. Strategy was to sell before ER then buy back after ER."
That worked out nicely
We'll see on Friday.
"People take profits.

Nio‚Äôs earnings are good and will help for the longterm"
Ugghh.. my callsüò´üò´üò´
"Same thing happened after Tesla's Q2 ER. That one qualified them for being included into the S&P 500, so normally it would have mooned but instead it tanked. This is people taking profits while they can.

Nio isn't falling back to mid single digits again like people expect. The company is simply too strong now. As I stated in a previous post, and I've seen a lot of similar sentiment, this company would have a MUCH higher valuation if it were a US company.

Let's also not ignore the Trump Admin submitting new recommendations to the SEC to delist Chinese stocks that are not adhering to GAAP standards for financial audits with companies listed on US exchanges. One side of me understands, as Nio doesn't submit their financials to SEC for audits, so we don't REALLY know if these reports are accurate. Thank Luckin Coffee for that speculation. Personally, I think it'd be a lot easier to fake a coffee company than an EV manufacturer.

The opposite side is that we, US shareholders, have our investments threatened. We can always gain access to the stock via other exchange platforms, but moving our assets like that around is nauseating to green investors. Major institutions will find their way as they always have. That panic sell, and I'm guessing that some of the deterioration we see today is related to this news, will cause the stock to tank.

Long haul, this is a solid company. Reviews on the vehicles are surprisingly positive. They made their presence known in the world of super cars and succeeded incredibly. But to compare Nio to Tesla, NKLA, is a bit of a misdirection. Tesla is an energy company that happens to make cars. NKLA has barely broken ground, literally, on their factory in Coolidge AZ. Nio is manufacturing EVs and selling them with a growing demand and excelling business. China WANTS and NEEDS EVs, not just to make a better product but to also drastically cut down on their smog pollution that hangs over cities like Beijing, a shroud of illness and death not just for people, but their environment at large. They KNOW without EVs, that situation will get worse.

I believe the race to sell vehicles isn't for market dominance of vehicles, but for batteries. Tesla's weak point is that you have to charge your vehicle. Long drives aren't fun when you have to wait 40+ minutes at a recharge station. This limits the general range of the unit, and more importantly, the customer. 

Battery swap tech completely changes the game. It's next gen gas stations. I liken a battery swap station end goal to the USB port. If the leading EV manufacturer can establish battery swap dominance, would the next step not make more sense to establish a standardized battery make for all EVs? Sure, you may lose some steam on vehicle sales as it gives customers more options, but if you reach a standardized battery swap tech for the industry, well that's a muuuuch bigger fish to land. License out the batteries that get swapped to other EVs and suddenly, not only do you have your own EV company, you create a new kind of energy company. 

üê≥üê≥üê≥"
"NIO has high IV, google ""Implied Volatility"""
BOGDANOFF called in the dip
Hold through the day or sell??
It will go back up. People taking profits and some bailing out of fear. The company is doing well and people know this and will keep buying after they relax imo.
"That‚Äôs been the case for pretty much every stock after earnings. I‚Äôm buying more and fully expect it to climb back up. It‚Äôs probably not going to rocket up to 20, but we should seek some gains in the coming days/weeks"
Don't know. I'm annoyed myself
"Same, lost all my gains in the past month in one day lol. Oh well, I'd hold off until end of the week."
damn i was gonna buy thousands in calls too buy i held off. glad i did. options a dangerous game -\_-
That‚Äôs why you should buy shares as well
üôàüôà
I feel ya. I was hoping to sell at a nice profit today.
U better be more active on this threadüòú
"Just want to add that Tesla is the biggest short in the US market, shorters lost billions, and also google $TSLAQ. A lot of people also shorted $NIO, obviously not as big as $TSLA."
"If you don't mind me asking, when did you first start investing? You seem savvy. Im in my mid twenties and only a couple years into it. Caught NIO around 2 dollars a share and have been holding. Its my first real successful trade. I had TSLA as well at around 200 a share but had to sell because of medical bills. Im just curious to how long you have been doing it and what are some of the lessons you've learned, if there are any you'd like to share"
"It seems that many people missed the delisting FUD, that's why it tanked today.

NIO will be second to Tesla on the EV market and Nikola will be NKLAQ by that time."
Is it good time to buy before it jumps back ?
I was just amazed at the way it is behaving after the report... i am holding on ... NIO ALL THE WAY !!!!
Why you in the forum if you looking to sell on a down day. You should be here for the long haul rocket üöÄ
Hold. I'm hoping for some green starting tomorrow
"Bro, just hold for 3+ years. Price will be around $90."
literally nothing bad happened in the conference call. fucking profit takers and shorts
Yep. I definitely think things are stabilizing now though and it's going to go up slow but sure with a few little downs. It got upgraded also which is even better. The thing that's really killing it imo is Americans ( I'm American) that dislike and don't trust the Chinese and trump and delisting fear that will never happen ect.... and so on.
">ains in the coming days/weeks

15-16 is doable in a month or two"
"I'll be 32 in a few months and started about 3 years ago. So not really a bunch of experience, but I do feel I have a MUCH better understanding on how the economy really functions, and of course, we'll never know enough, so stay hungry for knowledge. Based on what you've stated for your Nio holds, you're in a MUCH better position than I am. I started in with an average of like $3.70s, so good on your for getting in lower and holding through. Sorry to hear about the medical bills, it sucks selling at that point and kicking yourself as you watch it absolutely soar into the heavens. I bought a handful of SHOP shares back when they were like $95 and panic sold, so I'm familiar with the feeling of what could have been.

Lessons in my brief time?

\#1 - Be. Patient. Don't let the autists at r/wallstreetbets trick you into hype. Hype is always good and needed, but the hunger to strut their gains the way they show, that just likely won't be you, or me, or much of anyone. \~80% of options expire at a loss. All the fake internet points in the world will not help you pay your electric bill.

\#2 - READ - It is in your best interest to read and consume materials related to the economy. CNBC is my go to for financial NEWS, not investing advice. Big difference there. I also work for a bank, but not in the investing branch. Still, I was able to sign up for our daily and weekly new letters that come out that touch on the macro US economic news of the day. I have a lot of trust in what those newsletters say, as they have proven VERY reliable. Still, it's good to look at other reliable sources. Reuters is a good reference too. Overall, company news gets covered pretty well on the bigger sites. And they always have links to other articles to at other sources. CNBC just happens to be my portal. Books are good too! Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad Poor Dad is a must read imo. It isn't without it's criticism, but it gets you thinking differently about money. Dave Ramsey is good too. And Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People is an absolute must as well just for life in general. Documentaries are great too! Personal favorite is The Men Who Built America. It's pretty dramatized but lays out how the original monopolies began to run amok at the turn of the century. But they did it because they could foresee how their products would shape the world. It takes a lot to look that far ahead. Super fascinating if you look at it from that perspective. Amazon streams it i think?

\#3 - When wanting to invest in something, look at sectors first. Understand who the big players are and WHY they're big players. My mistake was that I invested too early without better DD. Now my DD is relatively better, but its taken a while to understand. Use ETFs for sector investments, but if you think you've got a good buy, buy the individual stock. EVs are a symptom of the Green Revolution that is coming. It will take decades to play out, but EVs are a good place to start. Think of it like if EVs work for consumers, what's next for commercial? A hard question. Can you see planes running just on electric? What happens if one is hit by lightning in the air? Or the massive shipping barges all over the world? Cruise ships? Solutions for those are decades away, but coming nonetheless. The world will inevitably exhaust its fossil fuels at some point. And with an ever expanding population like China, all that smog and pollution will be too much for people to tolerate. Hence why there is such a push for EV industry in the region. 

\#4 - Employer sponsored 401ks and IRAs are good! I have them. But an additional retirement account outside of the employer match... ehhhh doesn't really jive with me. My work matches me at 6% and I'm putting away 7.25% too. I know a lot of people keep their stuff in retirement accounts, but I have a different opinion on those entirely, especially if you're doing regular trading quite frequently. I'm a long term holder so I'm still buying, generally not selling.

Hope this helps! Anything else just ask away. :) Positive vibes ya'll."
Always a good time ! I‚Äôd still wait to see what tomorrow brings IMO I think another red day
"Lol, the sub wasn't exactly right about today, so I wouldn't put too much weight into the answer you're going to get. 

But if you see the report as a good thing long term and you don't mind having your money tied up for a while, then go for it."
Only you can decide.
"You are right, I‚Äôm holding this shit to my grave."
"Probably sooner than that, hopefully lol"
"Wow. Thank you so much. I agree with everything you said especially regarding reading about the economy daily and i really appreciate you sharing your sources and how you do it. Its funny you mention the book Rich Dad Poor Dad. I swear to God I read that book 3 years ago and then started my own lawnmowning and landscaping company within a month of finishing it and now that company is actually doing okay. Fantastic book. 

Also funny you mention shopify. Robinhood actually gave me a share of SHOP at 125 for free! For recommending someone I got that share. I sold at 259. Im like what are the odds the free stock they gave me would soar. Anyway. Thanks again i will take your advice seriously."
"Hypothetically, suppose the HFCAA does pass. NIO will have 3 years to comply until they get delisted right?

Also if they get delisted would they trade on the OTKMKTS? If so what impact does otc have on share price?"
"I agree, a lot of bad advice on this thread"
Yeeeeeee üí™üèº
Ohhh man I wish lol Weak hands got me way back then. Glad you found success!

Yup
FOMO is going to kick in big time for some people!
"I bought some more nio just before close, gimme them tendies!"
Yeah I might be buying even more tbh
"Iv'e sold before earning and doubled back my position, amazing call!"
NIO is undervalue af. FOMO
Nio went down quite a bit lol
"This aged very well, get in now, while the stocks being manipulated."
meh. still a good long term play
"I agree, but the rush to buy at opening bell is never good advice."
"As we are always coming back to comparing Nio to Tesla and they are & will be the leader in the EV/car market, I thought that I could recommend it here too.

I'm not done yet reading it but if you have any investment in Tesla, I highly recommend to read this book. Very easy to read and a great insight into Elon's history and way of life.

Please don't buy it on Amazon and get it from your closest local bookshop, they need the support more than Besos."
Im broke
Stay strong. This does not make sense.

If it hits 60 ill shit my pants.
"Just fyi, price targets generally is a projection within 12 to 18 months, but that's a pretty sweet average price target. :D Can't complain."
Just told my wife if it hits 60 this week I‚Äôm buying a brand new car.
"If Nio were a US based company, it would already be there. It won't hit 60 tomorrow, but that valuation being probably 2 years out is still welcome. Here's to hoping for a success tomorrow y'all!"
Where specifically are you seeing this number? I‚Äôm not finding it anywhere.
The stock price is not going to fucking hit $60 tomorrow. You guys be realistic come the fuck on. Keep averaging down with your paycheck you'll probably hit that mark in a year or two
Why is everyone saying if this hits it tomorrow or this week? this is a price target not a predicted price to occur?
"Yooooooo, if it hits $60 tomorrow (I know it won't) my heads gonna explode lmao"
"Don‚Äôt want to be pessimistic , but what kind of earnings do you think would drive a 46$ increase within a week. This seems like a 3-5 year price target, this isn‚Äôt Kodak"
"That's an EOY target, not a prediction. If it even hit $16 this week I'd be happy. I'm holding 10 13.5 calls that expire the 21st. So I'm hoping tomorrow it moons a little."
Is it a typo. I love the number if it can be real.
"Good outlook bois, holding this company for many years to come"
What does that target price mean?(in what time frame? 1 year? 5 years?) I have a LARGE holdings of iQIYI at $15 I bought awhile back and their target price is through the roof  [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/iq/analystestimates](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/iq/analystestimates)

You‚Äôll regret driving that car 4 years from now when nio trades above $150+ Hold! This is going to be a sweet ride - no pun intended.  üòä
"Hate to break it to you my friend but, NIO isn‚Äôt hitting $60 this week! It‚Äôs an ESTIMATED AVERAGE . it‚Äôs also not in a week,!!!! It‚Äôs gonna be over a year at least, if you really don‚Äôt know this simple stuff you should consider removing your money from the market"

Got some sad news buddy
Thanks. Just checked it out on my desktop as the full data doesn‚Äôt show up on mobile.
You underestimate the power of 1)meme power 2) robinhooders 3) merger hype
"Lmao, I just wished that there wasn't any ""USA vs China"" shit going around at this time so NIO can fucking moooooon."
"Yeah, I was just reading the comments in the thread. As much as I want hype around this company, if it‚Äôs fleeting lots of us will lose"
Yeah the government backing is definitely beneficial
"The way it has been traded the last days, it will be $13.95 EOD.
Edit: told ya"
"Lmao, but hype sell news I suppose"
"Do you have a good source of info for me on what to use over Robinhood? I just started at the beginning of Corona and it‚Äôs all I have. Why is it so negatively received BTW? 

I have no interest in doing this daily, but I love reading and learning and a lot of patience. So I figured if I just apply some of this to a potential to make a few extra dollars it couldn‚Äôt hurt too much."
"Well fuck trump and the CCP, we want to get rich !!!"
"That would be a pump and dump... yes, not good if it doesn't stick"
Yeah they can fuck each other up after we sell our shares and calls
Not this one
a stock can be both
Wow
Wait are they actually starting production of this beauty? I thought it was at least a concept now?
Not sure if the translation is wack but it saying the car will be available end of year? Thats crazy
When is nio day?
This is generally good news. Chinese companies are undervalued because there is always that scare they are cooking their books. The surviving ones out of this purge (hopefully NIO) should gain shareholder confidence
"Doesn‚Äôt seek to delist. They want to impose stricter auditing measures, and there are multiple ways firms can comply. From a bottom line perspective this means additional external accounting costs. Also for already listed firms this won‚Äôt apply until Jan 2022."
Very interesting. Link to source?

"As I have understood NIO owns the battery, but they rent it out. Whenever your car runs out of electricity you drive in and rent a new battery (swaps it in 3 minutes).
It's kind of like paying for charging your normal electrical car. You can also charge them.

I have also red that everytime you swap your battery, the swap station does a check of the battery."
"Hate to be the devil‚Äôs advocate here, but I was watching a YouTube video last night. And one of the comments raised a question. Let‚Äôs say NIO does catch on, swapping stations are going up. How will swapping stations work with other brand EV‚Äôs? How can it be standardized? I can‚Äôt see properties being sold all over the map for one specific brand vehicle. Also, let‚Äôs say NIO produces a coupe, will the batteries fit said smaller chassis?"
"You pay for how much you ‚Äúneed‚Äù 

You come into the swap station with 75% used and 25% left they will give you a full charged battery = 100%

You pay for 75% since your battery has 25% left"
"thinking outside the box, it might be that NIO simply controls the standardization. 

Assume they have the know how to swap their batteries, other would have to build to NIO like systems, maybe kinda like how everyone has to live with USB ports"
"Every car they have by now has the same chasis, but I guess that they will try to make the battery universal for every chasis they will make... So far they are only in China and are banked by the government so there will be no problem with property."
"Yes, of course. Forgot to add that, thx"
"Where are you from? Robinhood seems to be the go-to for Americans. I'm in EU and using Revolut and 212. Also I don't think 212 does options contracts, whole Robinhood does."

My only complaint about robinhood is pre market trading hours, I wish it could be extended. (Pre-market begins at 9 am EST on robinhood)"
"I use 212, Robinhood is not available in the EU. I'm very content with 212"
What's 212?
I'd never heard of it until after I created my Robinhood and Webull accounts.
"I dropped robinhood and use schwab

Free trades and better servers for surges"
I signed up for trading212 the other day (UK). I wanted to spread my cash around various brokers incase of failure of one of them
"I see, I am in the UK so that seems to make sense now thank you"
Yes I like 212 also but I was worried I was somehow roped into a bad deal because it seems no one refers to it
Trading 212. It's a broker like Robinhood. Not very popular.
"Ohh nice idea, I might steal that one"
"Oh no you didn't, I see quite a lot of people using 212 in videos etc. You can trust it for sure"
"Oh it is pretty popular, but mostly in the EU"
All of this is easily found under IR on Nio's website.

That's the earnings call. The report should come out before then. No specific time I don't think. Last time I don't think it came out until close to 8.

"Well I would say that it is partially priced in on the July vehicle delivery numbers, but the other important stuff like profitability and margins, q3 guidance.. if exceeds expectations leaves good room for further up."
"Earnings are always tricky. Especially with an ADR like NIO and increased tensions with the US and China don't help the cause for the stock to moon. Even with good news, the stock could tank. That's just the earnings game. I've seen a lot of price estimates from analysts saying it will fall to around $7 - $8. The best we can hope for is a nice gap up that causes a short squeeze on all the short volume so they have to buy back in a little to cover their positions. 

IMO, I think we will see a  gap up and FOMO buying, then a drop. I pray it moons to $20, because I'm holding +10 Long calls at the 13.5 strike expiring on the 21st lol."
"Given that they gave delivery numbers for April - June already, I'd imagine it's priced in. No surprises in store. But I'm usually wrong"
"Definitely not chief , we hit 16 within the past month. There's still a lot of room for growth."
May help to get more positive details about expansion plans.
"Despite the record deliveries, they likely record a loss again. 

Depending on how bad/good it is, the stock could crash back to 9-10$ or run to 20$+.

Copy from other comment:
It's all about the expectations and the real numbers in the end.

If it's lower than expectation, a drop to 9.40-10$ will be healthy as it's the 0.68 fib on the last run up. Also it would close the gap.

New position: At 0.05-6$ the contract 10$p 14/08, I went and took 10."
whole market is down and on top of that Tesla is also down and NIO is a chinese company. So they are taking the beating in stock price.
"Yeah, I witnessed that first-hand with NET (Cloudflare) last week. Played earnings, made some profits, and then that shit tanked. Got lucky admittedly. If Nio does tank I won't panic though"
"I didn't watch Q1 but didn't Li make bold promises for Q2 regarding the gross margin?

Either way, I don't believe many believe know of NIO yet. I know the guy on CNBC talked about it, but I doubt its mainstream yet. And also it's a chinese company, so I understand if investor sentiment is a bit wary coming into earnings. I don't think it's priced it because the previous jump from 11ish was due to the delivery numbers for July, and today spike is probably somehow related to the stimulus measures passed by Trump.

&#x200B;

I am hoping the price sinks pre-earnings at least below $14. I avg'd around $11 but I wanna get in before earnings.

&#x200B;

If Li deliveries positive news this will be a monumental occasion for this stock and unless there is some insider trading going on I doubt anyone knows what will happen tomorrow"
after hours looking really good
Also they could release pre orders for the ES6
"Deliveries is probably the most exciting part of earnings for an EV company, but things like their profit margin on each vehicle could constitute big news. Guess we'll wait and see"
People keep saying it will drop to below IPO price. I can guarantee you it won‚Äôt. They‚Äôve shown enough consistency in sales to be at a higher floor than that.
"So you say the stock with either go up or down?

Man youre a genius"
I find your downvotes on this comment weird. Sure it's speculative but that's all us plebs are doing on this sub. Cheers for the reply
"The way it's been trading, I think it would take really poor ER to drive it down to $10. Good luck but I think that was a bit aggressive. I can see a pull back to $12.00 - 12.50 though. I have similarly tempered expectations in the other direction as well. I doubt we'll see $20 this week, but I can see it breaking $15 and maybe even testing ATH."
"Good points sir. I agree about the whole China fear factor in relation to this stock. I don't have an exact quote but I did hear that Li promised a positive gross margin by September iirc. There's speculation that this earnings got moved forward because they've reached that already, but who knows. Certainly a positive gross margin ahead of projections would be a big catalyst."
"It's all about the expectations and the real numbers in the end.

If it's lower than expectation, a drop to 9.40-10$ will be healthy as it's the 0.68 fib on the last run up. Also it would close the gap.

I'm holding some 8/14 14c as well but will probably sell today if it goes up as I have been burned by IV crush before. I'm holding a lot of shares though so I am optimistic long term even though I am expecting the price to drop post earnings. Good luck!
"The fact that they moved the earning report ahead of schedule indicates they have some good news that they want to discuss.  If true, we are going to retest $15 with $20 as the next price target."
"Pardon by ignorance (new to options), but isn't it a bad idea to buy calls as of now due to the huge IV the stock currently carries?"
"11.90 to 14.50 because of they delivered +3k cars on July! And that number is low from the previous month but you see +3$! . So, What do you think about GOOD earning !? 

To the mooon ."
I dont know how much you paid your contracts but 10$p are 0.06$ right now. You could cover your ass for cheap.
Yeah I‚Äôm holding a lot of shares and long leaps. But I took some profits out from the silver run up and was looking for possible short term plays before I pump more shares in :)
Do you recommend buying long calls after earnings? Or would the reduction in IV paired with the increase in stock price (hopefully) cause the option price to go down?
"For sure, I ended up selling them in the morning when it popped up past 14, IV getting way too high and didn‚Äôt look like it was going much higher from there. Looking to just get some shares until after IV drops back down"

"Extremely excited for the overseas expansion. It also just dawned upon me that their implementation of BaaS effectively puts NIO as an EV company + charging company (such as BLNK) + lifestyle company (with their NIO houses) at the same time

However, given the current situation of the virus in the States I would think that the NIO houses won't be as strong of a pull"

Wondering what the international strategy will be in regard to battery swapping.
"This has been mentioned for a long time already... but to be frank the soonest it should happen is later half of next year. They need to scale up to at least 10-15K per month production line, focus on the Chinese market, and start laying down the infrastructure and planning in Europe in order for the full NIO value and brand to do well there."

In for 500 @$3.66.  Not fucking selling.  This shit is going to blow up!
"NIO is going to the moon , buckle up !!!!! This is the year and we're just getting started."
"Nice analysis, forgot to look at the short sellers number, thanks for the reminder"
Thank you for the analysis on the shorts! I believe NIO 8/11 earnings will be a good one and bring us to the MOOOONüöÄüöÄüöÄ #NIOFORLIFE
"Does anyone else think that regardless of the ER being good, the stock will drop some after the news?

I‚Äôm still long and strong with NIO, but I get the feeling we may see a small dip on Tuesday"
I have been paying close attention to what you said about there being few sellers on the down days.  That is a very good sign for the health of the stock and I believe they are going to report a positive gross margins on Tuesday based on the reigned in operating expense number from the first quarter.
"Bigger question to me is why ppl will short when they know that there is very positive news coming, I saw same action in AAPL where puts increased significantly on the day after ER. 

Can someone explain to me the mechanisms and why shorts are so excited in getting killed! What‚Äôs shorts goals and what‚Äôs their real incentive?"
"I just want to make sure I'm understanding correctly. Are you saying that because there are so many short positions, on top of expecting good Q2 earnings, would in turn drive stock price up more because the short sellers have to buy the underlying stock?"
"Well, even with a good bump today the volume was low.  Let‚Äôs hope your prediction here unfolds over the next few days."
"I‚Äôve been trading on robinhood for about half a year trying to understand how the stock market works. I have some questions about this very subject. I bought around 250@12 and kept it for a month and sold when it reached 14 on Monday. The price dropped back down to 13 and bought back in 350@13. Now, I plan on keeping with nio long term but is what I did considered shorting? Also did that move make any difference in my investment or should i have just kept it at the low 12 and bought the dip?"
For this reason I'm looking forward to experiencing a bump into the 18-25 price range off of earnings
9/04?
"I hope not but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised , could be another Apple/Microsoft earnings where good, just isn‚Äôt good enough for some people."
"Shorts and Put buyers are usually short term traders, looking for profit. They expect the price to drop, so they ""enter"" with a short instead of a ""buy""

Using Tesla for example, since it's the most shorted stock. When Tesla reached near 900 in Feb, these people think it's over valued, so they short; The easily bagged 150 per share as TSLA drop to 750.

Then Tesla hit 800 again, short, make gains again... this continue until late June... when they short, but prices keep climbing... it hit their stop-loss, which the shorts have to ""Buy"" back to cover... this causes the price to shoot even higher.

Although you see shorts getting killed, but they actually make lots of profit. As the saying goes: ""Prices take the stairs up, but jump out of the window when going down""

\---- 

For APPL. Those people think that Apple went up 10% after earnings, price seems too high, so they short or buy puts.

NIO, no different. Price was already up 10% last Monday. They concluded that a good earnings is  already priced-in, so price should drop, short... I think they likely didn't do their homework, as last Monday's spike was due to excellent delivery for July."
"At the moment you have 1. New Short Sellers who have accounted for 26% of the total volume 2. Other older Shorts who may be covering 3. New Longs buying 4. Old Longs largely cashing profits 5. Day Traders
Item 1 & Item 2 may be close to 50% of the total volume so they are dominating trading clearly trying to keep the stock down. Almost ALL these Short have lost money or are losing money. The ONLY weapon they have to keep the NIO Stock from rising is to short more stock. A bit like a Cocaine Addict whose only solution is to have another shot. What happens when Item 1 goes close to ZERO. New Shorts do NOT want to short NIO. Then you will get an imbalance of Buying versus Selling and the Stock may be explosive on the upside. When Stock goes UP, then Short Sellers get daily margin calls. If they do not meet those margins calls they are bought out of their position. All of this creates a Perfect Storm on the Upside IF NIO delivers good earnings."
"No your sale had nothing to with Short selling. You owned the stock & you sold. To give you example of Short Selling.
On Friday there were 41.0 Million Shares being sold by people who had shares to sell. IN ADDITION there was 16.7 million Shares Sold Short. These people arranged to BORROW shares & then sell them.
So 41.0 plus 16.7 equals total volume of 57.7 million
So basically 29% of total volume was people who sold shares they did not have but borrowed. Those SHORTS probably total at least 127 million as last reported with latest numbers coming out this Wednesday. Those Shorts are losing a lot of money. They are doing their best to make the stock look bad daily, as that is in their interest, so that is does not go up. IF Q2 earnings are good, even if some of these Shorts start to cover & other lose their appetitie to short more THEN the stock is potentially explosive on the upside. Of course the Shorts will do everything in their power to make that not happen. Remember the NIO Shorts just like the Bullion Gold Shorts who have gotten killed are typically a lot better funded than the retail NIO long shareholders. It is just that sometimes they get thing horribly wrong. In Q! when NIO was having trouble meeting payroll & the stock was $2 these NIO Shorts were probably licking their lips looking at bankruptcy. Little did they know that Tencent Govt of China & 6 Chinese Banks would provide billions plus the NIO Vehicles sales would shoot up. Now they have lost hundreds of millions & stand to lose hundreds of million more"
"Shorting means you sell the shares first then buy back later. 

RH doesnt allow shorting, so you are fine."
But what if people sell on the news of good earnings
possible short squeeze
If the price jumps enough it will create a short squeeze. Heavy weight of people shorting this on the ER.
All I care about is NIO
"Xpeng is an interesting company. P7 looks like a good car and I believe it will take some market share of Tesla 3. Here is my view on these companies. Tesla, Nio, Xpeng will eat off market shares of ICE cars in China. And as time goes by, the Tesla brand aura wears off, Nio will be the flagship Chinese EV followed by Xpeng and maybe some other companies."
Crash like Li Auto?
Unemployment just got extended by trump so those RH$ will be coming in.
"Of course, this will benefit us"
$18 to $16 hardly qualifies as a crash
The car looks pretty sick! Interested to see the initial pre-order numbers!

"Wrong sub. Go to wsb, we people can understand and care about that"
ok. nice to know. what else.
What does this mean other than people expecting the stock to fall?
It means that nio has gay bears infestation
How do we eradicate them?
"You welcome them in with open arms, every stock that is on a rocket needs it‚Äôs group of haters. Their parents were against TSLA originally and now they can‚Äôt pay their mortgages so little Johnny is just repeating the cycle for NIO"
They will be extinct when earnings will blow up expectations.
"I wouldn‚Äôt even count on earnings making them extinct. It would be a couple years to make them extinct, even TSLA still has haters. Just learn to love the hate and hold on tight."
The more haters the better. Stocks only go up and bears are always on the loosing side. Well most of the time
Brand recognition is there and business model is proven good and funding is secured. Its only a matter of finding new manufacturers to outsource production or raise capital to set up its own manufacturing plants. I am sure NIO will be producing more than 5k cars in Q3.
"I have a friend in China that just checked for me, the EC6 has a delivery window of September (e.g., if you order an EC6 today, it will be delivered in September).  Yes, they will grow."
He‚Äôs also been saying buy AMD and NVDA for a long time and that‚Äôs paid off
He cannot be seen saying buy Chinese stock 3 months before the election. I actually like the guy a lot.
Old Jimmy is a boomer looking at p/e ratios and eps. None of that matters in this market
"It took him a long time to finally understand Tesla, an USAn company so imagine how long it will take him to understand that China>USA(except Tesla but Tesla is half Chinese now) for the EV market that is just starting."
Same thing he does when he said NVAX was a SELL when it was moving ~$50-70 early last month.. then boom boom and 189 52 week high 2 days ago.
"People always complaining about profitability... of course it is not profitable in the short run, we are in the business of selling electric vehicles, not hamburgers"

"I got in originally at 2 but only a small amount since then I‚Äôve added a lot more around 12-15 mark. I want to kinda sell now take half the profits and keep going but tbh I have faith in the long hold. I‚Äôm looking 3-5 years hoping for it to be 20-40$ mark  , but as others have mentioned this one is a long hold/ retire early mentality for me. Nio is very volatile so if your looking for options it‚Äôs good to wait for dumps and pumps but if it‚Äôs a stock investment I wouldn‚Äôt try to look at nio stock price too much as you‚Äôll lose your mind üòÇ"
I am going to hold until it reaches $100/share.
~ 5 years (as long as the storyline remain compelling to me)
I wouldn‚Äôt sell anytime in the near future. In other words: $1000
Samesiesssss
"Price is irrelevant, market cap is what the true value of the stock is, Nio is currently at 15B Market cap tesla is at 266 the multiplier between the two companies is 17.73 Times

When tesla was worth 100$ per stock the calculation is
1440 /100 = 14.4 
266B market cap /14.4 = 18B market cap at stock value 100$

so in conclusion the two companies are roughly equal in valuation at their current market cycle and growth."
why do people always overlook the market valuation cap....
You need to look at car production per market capitalisation to compare the 2 and even like this Tesla would have the advantage of being fully integrated.
Nio has 5x the OS than Tesla
Well I think in 12 months time the stock can easily reach $36 but in the short term I have revised my profit taking at $15 after ER. The fact that NIO stock is highly volatile means I will be able to buy it back at under $12 again soon.
I think so too.
"also to end on a positive note, I do believe NIO has alot ways further to go and is more capable to earn a profit on quarterly than tesla was before. I also do believe that as in BABA was to AMZN in the US 

NIO will be to TSLA so we should expect very substantial growth this coming year barring any black swan events"
Please provide further analysis on the function fully integrated
All fair stuff I hadn't considered....   I also think China actively pursuing being an EV leader is gonna allow Nio to grow rapidly...
They make more margin per sale as they produce/naufacture their cars and the software. The more they produce the bigger the margin too.
Pretty major things to overlook. Good learning lesson for sure
"But NIO isn't spending the crazy capex on factories, so it could easily be a wash"
"Not sure to understand what you mean there but Tesla strategy to own their factory has proven to be the best one.

Each new one being a major improvement, catching up is going to be really hard for other."
This isn't new.
"I feel like anyone who leaves Tesla, either got headhunted for big bucks, or got pressured by Elon to leave."
"Or burnt out. Elon says it himself. Tesla staff go work at Apple because the can't handle working at Tesla. You don't create the company he creates by going in and working 40-60 hours. The dude literally sleeps in the office and fully expects those around him to have the same ""complete the mission or die at all costs"", mentality. Most people go for 1-2 years because once that is on your resume, almost any door is open for you."
"Frankly speaking, there will be a panic selling of some sort. But will it affect Nio's bottom line? No. How many Americans use Wechat? Wechat is first and foremost a domestic app. As does Nio. In fact if it drops by quite a lot I am seeing it as a buy opportunity"
"Frankly, as a NIO stock holder since January, you kind of have to just roll with the doomsday headlines as they come.  So far I've seen: 

\-NIO doesn't have enough cash to meet payroll! 

\-NIO is going to be de-listed! 

\-NIO is a fraud like LK Coffee!

Still holding."
"imo it might make it drop, but as the trade war going more and more intense, nio can actually benefit from it in the long run, simply because China would not want US dominate in the EV field, and China government will give everything nio need to compete with Tesla. Just my personal opinion tho."
"If you panic sell because of news, investment is not for you."
Stop panicking. No it will not. This does not affect NIO directly
"panic selling - yes

Long term - I don't think so

but then again Trump is unpredictable."
I hope during the q&a for the conference call next week someone will ask the CEO or CFO about being American compliant with the accounting principles.
What is Tencent?  New here.  Sorry and thanks.
Doesn't tencent also have a stake in Tesla?
"Unfortunately, yes. There is a possibility"
Probably the same thing that happened after GS downgrade. If Biden gets elected we good
"And still +$$ I hope! üçª

Edit: Not sure why I said ""still"" given its way up since Jan as you mention."
"I mean, NIO did not have enough cash. That wasn't a doomsday article lol."
Can you help me find where I said I was selling?
Actually Trump is highly predictable. Right now the only play for him is China gave us Covid and only him will make them pay. Trump thinks if he get really tangled up with China bashing he will be a war president and get re-elected.
">Tencent

giant ass conglomerate in china in various industries, pretty sure they own a majority of fortnite  and invested a 15% into nio"
"Yeah, they own 5% of Tesla."
NIO is fine regardless of who becomes president.
Nio is focused on domestic market. I dun really think they're going to be affected ever. The only risk is Nio being delisted.
"If Biden gets elected, we won‚Äôt have money to put in to the stock market or keep our money if we take it out, or have a country for that matter. Because of Trump we have a strong economy so that people are investing. Only fools want to see law and order, a strong economy, and capitalism go down the tubes. You must not know about cause and effect. If you want to see people loose there investments and see the stock market crash, go ahead and vote in a tax hiking money taking Democrat who destroys economies, wealth, and put so many restrictions on business, our own savings , and retirement and see how that goes. Not to bright.  You need to stop watching CNN and start looking and studying the real world."
Hah fair point.  That was the one true omg moment for me. Though someone who has been holding since 2018 would probably have a different perspective
"it wasn't about you, it was in general for this kind of : ""if this bad for nio"" posts"
Your panic question post shows lack of knowledge and confidence in the stock and company
If NIO is delisted that would mean all the big Chinese companies such as BABA and Tencent would be delisted. American banks have way too much money invested in all those companies (NIO included). This is all empty threats from trump
"Damn man, you really need to re-evaluate where you get your info."
I'm in Canada LMAO. our system works pretty fine here thank you very much
I hope you apply just as much critical thinking to your stock picking
Loooool
I would have put it the same amount I have today at that price and I would be sitting way too pretty. But I found out about NIO literally 4 days after it went from 5 to 12ish area.
Ok

Ok so that‚Äôs a lie especially since it‚Äôs basically a hologram already
That‚Äôs not even a flex you sound like a cop
I‚Äôve done some analysis of their numbers.  If the cost reductions they achieved (40% reduction but maybe related to COVID slow down) in Q1 carry over into Q2 in any way I believe they will achieve a positive gross margin.  That‚Äôs just me running numbers though. Hard to tell if the reduction in cost is sustainable if they have to keep dumping cash in R&D moving forward.
Is earnings September 22nd? I‚Äôm seeing August 11th in some articles for some reason
They moved it forward to 11th August!
Are you kidding me?! I missed out on the ride up fuck me
"https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-report-second-quarter-2020-financial-results

Still time to get in before it jumps to 20 after Tuesday üòÖ"
"You really think that‚Äôll happen after the earnings release? I feel like it‚Äôs priced in by now or going to be by end of Monday. 

I feel it‚Äôs common knowledge at this point that they‚Äôre doing insanely well"
"Maybe. I personally feel we are up 13% mainly due to the good July deliveries and the collab with Suning this is all good news. 

If they surprise us with some big update or the ec6 preorder numbers are ridiculous then I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it tested 18-20. 

But what do I know? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÑ"
"I could see that being possible as well

I‚Äôm so pissed dude. I was about to buy NIO on Monday at 12.40 and it ended up just running up to like $14. 

Same with WKHS, I was about to go in and it had a merger PR and flew to like $20. 

Missed out so much this week"
its down in pre
Yea trump banning everything China again fuck
"don't FOMO. 

you might get an entry point today if it goes lower.

tuesday will be a turning point imo. if li delivers on his promises, it'll go up"
"I agree. 

I‚Äôm waiting for $12.50 entry point"
Oh I‚Äôm not. I have 750 shares at an average of 12 plus 3 14c for mid September. Just hate that this weeks sweet little rally keeps getting sidetracked
frankly I see long term value in nio as the pioneer of the ev industry. especially if a democratic gets elected. lets see what happens
Same here. It‚Äôs a long hold for me
Most impressive.
The power van is a very cool idea.  Battery swap is cool too but I wish it wouldn‚Äôt need an attendant.  For the station to run out of fully charged battery and having to wait an hour for a fresh fully charged battery is ironic to 3 minute swap.
Who cares about a million mile battery when you can just swap.
"The manufacturer for the cost of the battery in the long run and so the customers as well as that saving can be passed on.

There is also more to the million miles battery that the number itself in term of lifetime, efficiency and performance.

When a lot more cars are EVs how many battery swap stations would be needed and how much will they charge you for it.

It's a cool option to have but not viable at scale."
"It sounds cool but doesn't sound practical even in his demonstration it sounded like a waste of time ""I looked and there wasn't any fully charged so I drove around for an hour to wait for them to be charged before swapping out my battery"". That's cool and all that it took 3 minutes to swap out, but you could have just saved time to charge the car instead of circling around for an hour to wait for one of them to be ready."
It would be much better with a reservation system.  If it only takes 3 minutes then there is no reason not to be proactive about it
I think you can also charge it by plugging it in.  swapping just gives you additional option and you don‚Äôt have to worry about battery aging out.
"It was better than that.. drove around for an hour and had to wait 3 minutes for the existing driver to finish.so total time was 66minutes 

 That being said the tech is great for initial consumers and apartments that dont have access to overnight. Takes a good 5-10min to get gas so this is right on par."
They have a reservation system.
"There are two ways to charge too. Plugging it in and a battery swap. Just that the battery swap is the fastest method and plugging it in for 10min will provide 100km. Apparently they have plans on how frequent you can charge it if you‚Äôre <200km away from home and needed charging, you can get NIO Power men to come over to charge it for free [(<2x/month of free charging on the free, default plan)](https://www.nio.com/nio-power). There will be plug-in charging stations but I‚Äôm sure people will get their battery swapped out the most."

"It's not that difficult if you think about it from the big money's point of view. It IS stock manipulation, but it's within the ""acceptable behavior"".

\--- 

Ignore your own portfolio, instead think of trading 10 million shares of NIO. That's over 130 million, huge sum for a retail investor, but not much in the eyes of the big money. 

Anyway, back on topic... let's say you want to buy 10 million shares of NIO. How will you do it?

\---

If you try to buy 10 million shares like you would do 10 shares, you'll face a problem: There isn't enough people out there that are currently selling their shares. Huge demand, low supply = price rise.  

You can get 10 million shares, but at that time, NIO price will be very much higher, and the average price per share you get becomes way above the current market number.

If you think NIO at 14 is value buy, but due to what you did, you end up with NIO at an average price of 17. This effectively means you lost 30 million (10m shares, $3 price difference) before the game even begins.

\---  

You can also put a limit buy... let's say, buy only when price is below X... This sounds good in theory, but due to the large volume, you've effectively created a support level.

When other traders see a huge buy order, will they sell their shares? Obviously not. If some big money thinks NIO will go up, why not hitch a ride... In fact, it will lure more buyers in, placing their stop loss at your buy price.

End result, you don't get to buy many.

\--- 

So, what will you do?

First, you enter by buying all available shares up to the max your acceptable level.

Then, you set a ""resistance"" to prevent prices from rising, then start buying at a lower price. This effectively creates a price channel where you control both top and bottom.

Whenever price rises, you put out a huge sell order. Buyers who see that will be deterred, since they can't break the resistance = they can't profit = they'll sell = price drop. Other stock holders, sees that the price is not going anywhere, so they sell too. 

You scope up all these reduced-price shares. After collecting enough, you move on.

If you know TA, this is reflected as the consolidation phase, where there's little price movement for a period of time, before something big happens.

\---

Why is this type of stock manipulation acceptable?

Because, the by-product of these actions is stability. If the big money can only buy/sell in large quantities, stock prices will be all over the place. 

Today, someone buy 10m shares, price goes up to 20. Tomorrow, another sell and price crash to 10. Will you even want to participate in this type of market? 

\---

Also, this type of manipulation are very temporary.

Look at this other angle: While collecting shares, NIO releases more good news. This lures another, or many other big money. 

Remember how we talked about the lack of shares in the beginning? Well, these newcomers face the same problem, but to their benefit, there's someone selling to make a resistance, so they'll happily gobble up all these ""Sell"".

This means the manipulator also has risk. They need to be wary of other big money. To minimize risk, they'll only raise resistance when necessary (price rising). 

The end result is most likely what you are seeing."
"Very thorough explanation, thank you :)"
Thanks for the explanation. Very enlightening. Today GS had a large buy order sitting at $13.09 and the same size sell order at $13.52. Its starting to make sense to me now.
"https://cntechpost.com/2020/08/05/nio-enters-into-strategic-partnership-with-chinese-retail-giant-suning/

More details here, also mentions

>	NIO members will enjoy platinum membership benefits at Suning Hotels, and NIO and its partners will become preferred customers of Suning Hotels.

which is important to me as it only creates more value for prospective customers who will be convinced by the NIO house ‚Äòmembership‚Äô and exclusivity that comes with NIO cars"
"Cant think of any other BaaS other than battery swapping.

Battery swapping was made free sometime last year. IIRC it used to cost $25 per swap.

I think the new EC6 will have to pay for swaps. Not sure how long ES8 and ES6 swaps will be free for.

EC6 will have battery leasing options so that the upfront car will be cheaper. I would guess, we'll see how successful BaaS really is sometime next year."
When did this partnership get announced? Is this priced in?
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs priced in.
"I'm not that ambitious, I only want nomi emoji pack."
"I understand the urge to go all in. Another solution is sell half your Tesla holdings, use half of that to double down and the other half to diversify your portfolio in something other than EV. That‚Äôs a win-win in my book."
Rule 101 of Stocktrading: NEVER put all your eggs in 1 basket.
"Hold both, keep up with the news, don't look at your portfolio everyday. Both long stocks. Diversifying is great for risk management, e.g. If something unfortunate happens to NIO, you got nothing else to fall back on. At the end of the day, it's your money, your choice."
 i will hold nio and ready to buy some xiaopeng once ipoed. no holding TSLA.
"You don't need to double down, its already 65% of your portfolio. I'd say put more into Tesla. They are building 3 giga factories at this moment. Tesla sales will easily triple in the next 5 years if not more. Tesla is also a far safer investment at this time IMO. I love Nio don't get me wrong, but like you at one point I had like 80% Nio and then it crashed 80% and I got decimated, and margin called."
"I agree with others who says diversify is a good idea. I don‚Äôt know if anyone noticed, but NIO moves very similarly with Tesla. Correct me if there‚Äôs a rational behind it."
Just bought another 510 on top of my 1400... Fuel that rocket ship to $20
"Maybe look at an EV etf, cover all."
"Buy some more NIO for sure if you are buying with cash. But if you are planning to sell Tesla for Nio, I don‚Äôt recommend that"
At least wait for battery day.
Don't forget NIU guys ;)
"All you need to do is do nothing. Both are great companies with great growth ahead. Tesla will scale at a faster rate depending. Not sure at what price you bought into but doing nothing is usually the best. 

I bought Tesla last year at $200+ sold at average of $600. I underestimated the growth and paid for it."
"Nio will never ever be worth the same as Tesla, especially right now where there are only rumors to suggest MAYBE Nio is going to Europe. Without US presence, I doubt Nio will ever top $100/share. 

Hold Tesla. Being that Tesla is both cars and solar panels/green energy, it‚Äôs basically double dipping. Hold the Tesla, and also hold your Nio. Both will do well, but Tesla will just always do better."
"Either something like this, or hold. Tesla are still leading the way in the EV market and if I had shares I would hold at all costs. I can understand the desire: I sold my meagre amount of stocks to double down on Nio, but I'd only begun investing and none of my other stocks moved"
This is the way
"diversifying must be the worst word in my ears. if you believe in a company and did enough dd for your requirements, put in as much as you are happy to lose considering the potential upside on the other side. if you want to diversify put your money in an S&P 500 etf or something, may give you some gains and reduces your risk, but it will not give you a chance to make a fortune"
Nah I think I will. I did my research
when is battery day? ;o
"I'm not sure I would go so far as to say TSLA will always outperform NIO.  TSLA has such high market cap right now, that I think it really needs a couple flat years to grow into it and prove the case for further share price gains.  NIO is at a scale that it needs to show its commitment to aggressive growth, but that said, when compared to TSLA at 50k units 5 years ago, it could be undervalued by $10b or so, if circa 2015 cash incinerator Tesla is the benchmark.  I think NIO will go to Europe and leverage it's German design heritage to grab that market.  Since Biden will take a more diplomatic tone wrt China, US plans could easily come into play post election.  But main question...it depends on how old you are.  If you are 30, sure, go for it, but drip in over a few months or quarters to minimize risks and try to set an exit plan that accounts for volatility in case things fall off the cliff.  As you get older, diversify more.  Just remember things can go really sideways at any time for almost any reason."
"warren buffet diversification is "" protection against ignorance "".

nothing says you cant set a stop loss and get out at break even if shit ever hits the fan. dont listen to the etf/basket fear mongerers. that shit is designed to keep the fools who blindly invest their money into a stock they have no idea of safe"
"If it doesn't get pushed back again again . :P 

September"
"I truly hope you don‚Äòt think this is WB‚Äòs secrete sauce. There are millions of such advices from other great investors, most of them mainly are aimed at risk protection, not performance maximization. always just depends on what you want eventually...
every decision comes with a pricetag, no matter what"
i know. just saying
NIOs US HQ is in San Jose. To my knowledge they have had some ES8s there for a couple years.
Are battery swap stations already in the US? Sorry if that sounded pretty dumb.
When will they launch in the US!? I‚Äôm so excited
Nice
Nope.
"Not dumb at all, but nope."
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs coming this year yet.
"I was under the impression that they do lots of r&d here in Silicon Valley, but for sales in the US, I doubt it will happen this year. But I wish I was wrong üòÇ"
Thanks. I thought it would of been here with the cars launched at the same time.
"I would be concerned if they‚Äôre planning to place it in downtown San Francisco. It‚Äôs so crowded and the local traffic is endless, so I hope they have a plan for plan for this ahead of time ü§ûüèª"
They need to buy one of the piers and just make that a battery swap location. I was also thinking of hospital and church parking lots as potential battery swap stations
Brilliant
"Interesting. Obviously Tesla can address this going forward, bit it could hurt them on existing models. Glad to see Nio didn't overlook this."
"I think the reports are wrong and it has no impact on Tesla.. on the flip side they aviod many many recalls since they can correct via software. The guy was a fool and you can still hit the manual button to use the wiper. Tesla has also done a very nice job on the vision based rain sensing.. its almost 99% perfect IMO. This was not the case a year ago(it was pretty bad) 

Just my opinion.  I am long on both companies and own a model 3"
"This is my biggest issue with Tesla. The ultimate strive to remove all buttons. I personally like the look of a cockpit with buttons and definitely prefer them for functionality than that god awful ipad they've gone with. 

I'd be ok with the ipad and buttons but to remove them all like even the glovebox is hidden behind five menus. I'd just rather not."
Should be more than 15.
Nice article! üëçüèº
"On what basis? This sub is like crypto in 2017 just jerking each other. 

Don‚Äôt make comparison to Tesla. American brands will generally always be worth more than their Chinese counterparts."
"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-shanghai-auto-show/nio-et-preview-hints-2021-electric-saloon

I agree, nice looking car."
"This was posted a long time ago. You won‚Äôt see another car in another year atleast. 

Reason why ES8,ES6,EC6 are in production is that the chassis is the same and can be produced in the same line. 

Making a new chassis like the ET would cost more money."
I just hope they will stick to the concepts headlights. Never really liked them being below the DRL in what looks like intakes.
I'll be the first buyer the moment they start sales in the US!
"What‚Äôs with the fucking shit posts on this sub, post higher quality content. At least provide an image with your post or something. Shit like this belongs in daily discussion"

Beautiful car
ya postponed. not abandoned. ye of little faith
Calm down Dad
"Not really postponed. They always launch new car on nio day and start production the next year. It was on sneak preview I would say, get ready for its official launch this December!"
fuck

"A bit of background: Suning is the largest commercial retailer in China

*On August 5, Suning and Weilai Automobile reached a strategic cooperation, the two sides will focus on channel expansion, consumer services, brand promotion, B2B cooperation, hotel business, intelligent manufacturing and other fields.*

*NIO will also open its showroom in Suning's exhibition centre and are planning to build an automotive smart retail experience store*"
"This is big news - not sure why it's under the radar.  This makes me even more bullish on their expansion and faster growth !!!!!

Next week of course is ER and this will fly :)"
Seems like this is priced in and part of the spike last week?
it clearly says August 5
Do you know what priced in means? Just because you get the news on august 5 doesnt mean everyone does. The reason i say this is because the stock barely moved today.
"Who cares if the stock barely moved on the news. If this strategic partnership benefits nio, then we will see it in the cashflow of the following quarters. 

If it has fundamental effects, then you will see the stock price react accordingly"
"Lol this is just dumb. Do you think analysts dont forecast cashflows and bake their projections in the current stock price? If for example Nio announced a new cybertruck and the stock price doesnt move, you would be surprised. No? That is news just like this huge strategic partnership is news"
What?
"Honestly though, when NIO IPO'd they had barely made any cars."
"NKLA is a vertically integrated company or so they say. They will outsource absolutely everything.   
Honestly not sure wtf they actually do other than marketing and talking.   
They have an idea but it's not even a new idea nor a great idea. Hydrogen trucks are already out there and other companies already building them. 

This company just seems like huge scam. Lots of talking, absolutely 0 results. On top of that...the lies. So many lies and contradictions coming out of them. They must have learned from Trump the art of the deal."
"I thought NIO doesn‚Äôt actually make their cars, don‚Äôt they pay a manufacturer to do it? Or is that not what you meant by ‚Äúmake‚Äù."
"Nikola earnings bro, horrid (80M loss 50k revenue). They still don't produce shit soooooo idk how people expect them to make money and they keep pumping the stock."
"Still , Nikola doesn't warrant it's valuation ."
By make I mean even sell a unit! Like Nikola hasn't sold a unit.
Doesn't Apple pay Foxconn to make their phones? Same deal.
"Nikola hasnt sold one car last I heard.  

Nio just released 50k EV cars to the regional Chinese police.  

They are competing with other EV: Mercedes, BMW, Tesla....

I want NIO to succeed."
Yeah I agree.
Where I do agree with you to a point I don‚Äôt necessarily agree totally. Some could argue that it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúloss‚Äù but money spent to where nkla is trying to go. The numbers looks bad but think of it a them investing in the company
Okay just odd wording.
"How many automakers have other companies make their own cars? Also one of the big criticisms I see of NIO is that they don‚Äôt make their our cars which will hurt profitability in the long run. I thought this was a jab at Nikola for not manufacturing their own cars. I heard NIO was going to transition to making their own cars, just didn‚Äôt know if it had happened yet."
"I‚Äôm long NIO. I‚Äôm just saying, but NiO would be a 30b+ company if it was in the US"
"Yeah I can see what your saying but a ""start-up"" does not warrant a 14B valuation, that's just ridiculous."
"true. nio a risk after all. its costly for them to operate with JAC motors, but maybe down the line they'll open up their own factory. only time will tell"
">Nio just released 50k EV cars to the regional Chinese police.They are competing with other EV: Mercedes, BMW, Tesla....I want NIO to succeed.

NIO stock price would be higher if Trump wasn't in charge and/or there wasn't trade tensions"
"Not to get political, but China does fuck the U.S over. As much as I want this to go to tendy town, China hasn't been our friend in a long time."
"No. I doubt Trump would piss off wall street like that, but who knows"
"NIO is always a high risk, high reward stock. US-CN foreign policy should be accounted for when investing in a Chinese ADR stock. If you think it is worth the risk, then jump in."
"If NIO gets delisted because of politics, wtf you think will happen to Tesla or Apple in China? Or a boatload of other American companies with heavy Chinese footprint.  
If it gets delisted because of legit reasons, nothing will happen, it's on them. But if it gets delisted because of politics or the orange clown accusing the car of spying...then it will be a shitshow. Time to exist the stock market altogether and grab some popcorn.  

More importantly...what happens to the stock market and 401k of millions of Americans?"
"I think all the delisting talk is just a bunch of hot air. A desperate man, Trump, and a desperate party, the Republicans, just blustering to try and create the narrative that China is bad and only Trump and the Republicans can save America. So first, a lot of individual investors, and more importantly, a lot of large institutions (think BlackRock, etc.) are invested heavily in the Chinese stocks listed on the NYSE. Delisting would hurt everyone‚Äôs bottom line, and those institutions have strong lobbying power. Second, delisting Chinese companies would greatly impact the world-class standing the NYSE enjoys today. New York is the financial capital of the world, delisting would damage that reputation and make New York second fiddle to the likes of London or Hong Kong. That would hit Trump personally. Last, delisting would honestly hurt America more than it would hurt China. Chinese companies would just list on other international exchanges and keep on truckin‚Äô on. Probably wouldn‚Äôt even bat an eye. Meanwhile, there would be more severe financial implications for stateside exchanges and investors. On a final note, everyone brings up Luckin Coffee and the lack of oversight, but cooked books happen everywhere, even with oversight. Remember Enron? The whole Luckin Coffee is just scaring American investors, and honestly, allowing savvy investors to get some cheap stocks. Compare the PE ratios for Chinese and American companies in similar industries  and you‚Äôll see much more appropriate PE ratios for the Chinese companies. In the end, do your own research into any company you invest in, Chinese, American, or otherwise. Make smart choices, but remember, fortune favors the bold. I think Nio is a bold choice with solid financials, in a subset of an industry that is primed for great things. Screw all this delisting talk."
No
You delist one the rest will scamper =no good
"Personally, I think the shit throwing between US-CN is more an acting front for the sake of the trade agreements.

Trump wants more chips on the table, so he does all those anti-gyna talks. Even tiktok has become a chip... if not, why is he making a fuss and acting like a 10yo... especially during pre-election.

If he manages to close a trade deal that's highly beneficial to the US-side, chances of being reelected will increase drastically."
No
"Can you please elaborate by what you mean when you say ""US-CN foreign policy""?"
Thank you for sharing
"should we be concerned about the fact that the shares we buy are only for 75% of Nio China? what would the impact if they were to further dilute this?

im a newbie with 50 shares."
He means exactly what that says...
Us China relations mate. Ignore the condescending replies
"I‚Äôm not overly concerned. Make no mistake that this was a last resort financing deal, but it doesn‚Äôt alter the value or potential of this company to any sizable degree. The way I see it, the night is always darkest just before the dawn. This loan was the dark point right before the Nio ‚Äúdawn‚Äù we are all witnessing. Furthermore, I‚Äôm not entirely sure of the specifics of the financing deal, but maybe there is a chance down the road for Nio to pay off the state investors and repatriate some of that value down the road. Finally, Nio needed this loan, but when Q2 results post, and we achieve a positive gross margin, and our reservation and sales trajectory continues upward, we won‚Äôt need a loan like that ever again. Ultimately, it was down to potentially going bankrupt, or our shares being worth 75 cents on the dollar. I‚Äôll take 75 percent of a share price over nothing any day."
US - China foreign policy*
"I personally would be pleasantly surprised if so. I reckon it is will be still negative but only just. 

More excited about any news on increases in production plans or plans to expand outside of Europe (maybe too early for that). Or more news on the ET7? Either way I‚Äôm feeling excited! ü•≥"
Either very close or in the positive. Likely to be close.
"As long as we see better margins we should be happy. I‚Äôm not expecting positive since it‚Äôs still quite early but if we do, that‚Äôs tremendous"
Li made big promises to reduce the negative gross margin.
"I was on the last earnings call, as an observer obviously. I remember the CEO saying they expected single digit positive gross profit margin to occur by the end of Q3 (implying Q3 itself is still slightly negative as the improvement will not have had time to reflect fully in Q3) and double digit in Q4, with Q4 overall being firmly in positive territory, with the increases mainly due to lowering battery costs over time, and economy of scale in ramping up production."
Iirc no Europe before 2022. But I‚Äòd be happy to see them here earlier. Especially with an ET.
"I am very happy with them taking the time to build as big as possible in 2021 in China and learn the best way to adapt the NIO offering to the European market, and by that point the other 4/5 cars that have been announced will be ready."
I thought they announced orders open for Germany now with deliveries as early as September.
"Nah, that has been false information by a shady stocks news page"
"How can anyone not be excited for this one, probably the most important earnings call yet. it will all be about the development of their gross margins. If they deliver on Li‚Äòs outlook (positive gross margin), the stock price will pop... if not we will probably go closer to 10 again"
I am not an analyst but I expect I will be laughing for at least an hour after the ER.
Very! What is the exact time?
"I feel the same, but that‚Äôs okay it‚Äôs $13~ right now"
"We all know it‚Äôs gonna blow out Q2 expectations. Q1 was horrendous and it was held at the aftermath of the pandemic. 

What I‚Äôm waiting for is Q3 guidance. Li Bin tends to be straight and honest so he‚Äôll give it to us straight if Q3 is going to be good."
How much stock do you think is sufficient enough to make a decent profit?
Did they move the date?
"I don‚Äôt think negative gross margins would make the stock go down to 10. Sure he has said it, but everyone knows positive gross margins is a stretch this early. As long as the margins increase, it‚Äôs a good sign"
"I see all indicators pointing to positive gross margins.  They managed their operating loss down significantly from Q4 to Q1.  If that held in Q2 and we already know sales increased dramatically from Q1 to Q2, then why wouldn‚Äôt there be good news here?"
Laughing all the way to the bank
You believe they're going to be that bad?
"On NIO's Investor relations: The Company‚Äôs management will host an earnings conference call at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time on August 11, 2020 (8:00 PM Beijing/Hong Kong Time on August 11, 2020). 

6 am for me :("
Q4 is going to be best
I have around 1000 shares currently. May buy more.
"Depends on what you think constitutes a decent profit and how long you‚Äôre looking to stick with the stock. If you have money to put in that you won‚Äôt need in the immediate term, add to your position on dips as u/Armani_67 said and stick with it for a couple years at least. Even if you don‚Äôt have a lot you can afford to part with right now, any money you put down in the near term and leave in there is likelier to turn a decent profit over the mid-to-long term."
"Yep, moved it to the 11th August!"
Nio ER 4 weeks early... companies do not bring forward their earnings reports unless there is something big to announce.
That good not that bad.
"Then wake the fuck up maggot, the rocket is on a schedule"
Possibly the first time we‚Äôll see 4K+ deliveries with EC6
Unfortunately I dont Have the capital for that.. but j slowly buy as much as I can over time.
Cool thanks yeah definitely a long term investment. I‚Äôm pretty excited for this company.
Shit. Should have bought at $11
So an evil laugh.
How can nobody like this motivational speech?
"Yeah for sure! Just be wary of the volatility, and buy the dips!"
Not a bad time to buy now. Down a few % today üòÑ

Thanks. Pretty new to the game.
This post doesn‚Äôt make sense. Goldman Sachs is also a top 10 shareholder in NIO. JP Morgan didn‚Äôt downgrade in your screenshot.
Look i get that people are angry at GS for posting a shitty downgrade. but this subreddit is for posting nio news
Just be thankful for many opportunities for cheap shares. It was the same as TSLA in the early days.
Donald Trump has a Goldman Sachs guy on his presidential cabinet. Just wait till he leaves the office. No way he delists nio. I‚Äôm pretty sure xi would have to retaliate in one way or another. But then again it‚Äôs trump so he might do so and repercussions to maybe Tesla?
Trump has a Goldman Sachs guy Steven Terner Mnuchin as his secretary of treasury. That‚Äôs the guy that‚Äôs been getting nio downgraded. No doubt.
I had to sell 10 shares of TSLA I had at about 200 a share because of hospital bills. That was just last summer and I had to sit and watch TSLA moon without me. It was literally the first share I ever bought in my life at 353 in 2018. Watching its success has been painful. I am happy to have NIO now. That's all ill say.
"No it‚Äôs not, the person who downgraded NIO is conspicuous."
">level 2Hayman3752 points ¬∑ 8 hours agoI had to sell 10 shares of TSLA I had at about 200 a share because of hospital bills. That was just last summer and I had to sit and watch TSLA moon without me. It was literally the first share I ever bought in my life at 353 in 2018. Watching its success has been painful. I am happy to have NIO now. That's all ill say.

Personally I would not sell shares unless I absolutely had to... you know shares are a long-term play?"
I was 21 and hospitalized with no other money left or I wouldnt have sold TSLA ever. Trust me I know. I've been holding NIO since it was at 2 dollars a share and have learned to use options since then. Thank you for sharing

Please ban OP u/DanHassler0
Look at the year
This was two years ago I think
Op kept posting either fake or irrelevant news.
"I don't think half the people here can read an article... He literally said July had the highest order growth (therefore demand side is fine). They had a supply chain issue and did not make cars for 1/4 if the month essentially, if this did not happen they would have delivered ~4100 cars. Really good news, and early earnings too."
"Just wait until next Tuesday, see y‚Äôall on the moon"
Factory was closed for 5 days due to floods. On a daily basis if it had have been opened deliveries would be above 4k. I think the market is smart enough to realise this so will boost the stock as it deserves.
Go NIO goooo!!!
[deleted]
"Seems like a kind of disappointing number in context of the previous month‚Äôs numbers, but then again, even in ‚Äò19 the July numbers were worse than June...so maybe it‚Äôs just not a big car buying month.

The stock is up regardless in premarket, so guess it‚Äôs not too bad!"
Why?
"It's crazy, up almost 12% üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"
"That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt trust rumors and don‚Äôt have expectations. Regardless, this is good news"
Earnings report
"Its awesome, but to be fair a lot of stocks is up today, even NKLA is up 12%"
Too much girl not enough car
I want to do this.
the car or britta?
Yes
"Really nice with the earnings report so soon! Previous years they did not do Q2 until end of September, but they expect it on Tuesday 11th August!"
This site post fake news. I wouldn‚Äôt trust their articles.
Nio calls!!!
‚ÄúStrong Buy‚Äù is a bit over optimistic.
Everywhere I look people are trying to discredit Nio for when they‚Äôre accomplishing. They‚Äôve beat expected earnings every quarter for almost the past 2 years.
Right.  Not even NIO would say they‚Äôre a strong buy right now.
"I said the site, not NIO itself"
They posted the 4K+ deliveries article. They shouldn‚Äôt be trusted
"5 days of no production. With avg daily production rate of ~120-170...they would have delivered 4,100-4,300"
"The big news was Li Bin said ‚Äúmore proudly, we have achieved a record-high monthly order growth attributed to the demand of the ES8 and ES6...‚Äù

This shows that they have demand for their cars and more of a production issue. IMO production constraints is more solvable problem than lack of demand."
Pretty consistent progress when you consider 5 days of halted manufacturing due to flooding.
"322% YoY increase is reassuring though it represents a -5.53% MoM from last months 3740 vehicles

Nonetheless, still a NIO long :) NIO‚Äôs BaaS is the way forward"
Any news/rumors about the ET7 car and if a new Nio factory in play?
322% increase year over year shouldn‚Äôt be ignored mate
"July is low season and they also had flooding impact 5
days"
definitely! though i guess i was just expecting a little more considering the unconfirmed numbers of ofer 4000 from another post
Looking at their annual reporting from 2019 and the first quarter.  They have reduced loss associated with operations by 40%.  The second quarter is the first quarter sales really jumped and would allow them to take real advantage of that move.  Reduced cost per vehicle and then vehicle revenues jump.  That‚Äôs a good combination.
It's usually a good news when the earning call is earlier than expected. ü§û
can someone share an article that confirms the august 11? I keep seeing posts like this but I can't find anything about this change on google. everywhere I look says something closer to sep 22
I have no clue but hoping they‚Äôre wanting to share that they achieved profitability
Q2 ended june so why would Aug 11 be considered early?
https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-report-second-quarter-2020-financial-results/
"I don't think they are so early.. The ceo said that they will most likely get there faster than Tesla did, but not already.. They might get closer to profitable, but I wouldn't count on the +side in the next quarters."
Because it was expected September 22nd until now.
Oh wow ok
Yeah not counting on it just total speculation.
"It shouldn‚Äôt have been, it should have been expected August 31st range due to their Q1 was in May. So technically it‚Äôs still two or 3 weeks early. But September wasn‚Äôt a good guess for some of the websites I saw"
We are all hoping ü§ûü§û
It was because of last year
That‚Äôs what I noticed as well
"It is still kind of good, as they had to stop production for a week and on top of that delays due to the floods."
"That should just be a comment under the previous post.

It was stated as unconfirmed and therefore to be taken as a rumor. 

Don't set your expectations too high on unverified data."
"With 5 days of no production, this is a good sign. What's even better is that they have shown consistency in this new floor of delivery numbers (~3.5k-3.8k). These are the new numbers to break and it seems highly unlikely they will go below 3.5k again."
"Yeah, and they had record high monthly order growth. Good to see there is increase in demand."
"Do you have any article about the floods and production stop? I mean I know there are floods in China for weeks now, just not sure about the production stop. Please post the link, appreciate that."
"Yeah, but I really think they need to ramp up production very soon. If they don't increase capacity, they will get large back orders by end of year"
"It says in the article linked by OP. Quoting ‚ÄúIn July, we are pleased to have achieved the second-highest monthly delivery results despite the impact on productions due to a 5-day suspension of manufacturing to prepare for EC6 productions and other flood-related supply chain challenges,‚Äù said William Bin Li"
"Definitely, they will hit 5k monthly production by September according to Li Bin."
"Ohh my bad, thank you."
"But I'm thinking ahead of that. If we expect growth every month (which we do obviously), then by nov/Dec, they should receive orders for more than 5k vehicles/month.

Hopefully they are planning to expand production further than 5k/month"
">NIO plant has a yearly 100k capacity, about 8k/month. We should see constant

Has Li Bin been delivering on his past promises and guidance? (Not hating just ignorant on this matter)"
"The JAC-NIO plant has a yearly 100k capacity, about 8k/month. We should see constant ramp up and hopefully a self owned factory or more partnership with legacy car manufacturers."
"Yes, and his guidances are usually more conservative."
Let's gooooo
"Hi just curious, where did you get this production numbers from?"
"It‚Äôs on their 2019 annual report. Ctrl-F and search ‚Äú120,000 vehicles‚Äù on the annual report using chrome will bring you to it."
 [article](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/08/02/tesla-model-3-had-more-sales-than-2nd-3rd-4th-5th-6th-best-selling-plugin-vehicles-in-1st-half-of-2020/)
Would represent a **11% increase** from last month which ended with 3740 vehicles
Continue to significantly outpace Xpeng and Li.  It‚Äôll be interesting to watch these three over the next few years.
What‚Äôs electricinvestor‚Äôs track record previously on these type of stuff?
Fake
"It‚Äôs not true, The CEO posted a few hours ago on a Chinese website that it wasn‚Äôt true. Lots of people are posting the screenshots on Stocktwits"
"Good article, lets hope the numbers are true! Can't wait for them announce a new Nio factory, there is clearly enough demand."
This doesn‚Äôt include pre orders from the show does it ? What if we get both numbers at the same time.?
Let‚Äôs wait till the official news gets out.
Would love this to be true
r/hedidthemonstermath
Very nice!
Rally 2.0 this week!
I will stay conservative and believe NIO stock will jump to $16 this week.
Okay so when is this stock going to hit 100?
Most of their news are references from Chinese websites which don‚Äôt show up in google and some from wall street journal.. atleast for me it‚Äôs one place stop for all nio news .. they follow NIO very closely..
"if numbers are true, how would the market receive it tomorrow or this week? can we expect to see the stock jump to ~20$ or more by end of the week, given the news is correct? Any takes?"
Also points to about 200MM revenue.  Looking at north of 3 Billion in revenue at this point on the year if growth holds.
r/theydidthemath
Yup. I'm definitely watching Li and waiting for Xpeng to IPO.
/who are they.
Having a nio factory doesn‚Äôt make sense. It is not in line with their overall strategy and they will have to take on more debt to make a factory thus putting the firm in bankruptcy risk again.
We have lift off!!!
"You asked a fair question, why all the downvotes? I think $20 is very possible after ER on next Tuesday morning if they announce a good surprise."
"Valuation in that case should be at least $21B compared to $13B right now. 

Usually for automotive companies it‚Äôs x7 the revenue"
r/theydidthemonstermath
"They‚Äôre overall strategy isn‚Äôt to build more cars? That doesn‚Äôt make any sense, please explain."
They just got a massive new line of credit? Surely a new factory is in the pipeline. Maybe they will announce it after the flooding is over?
"You‚Äôre misunderstanding me. Their strategy is NOT vertical integration: IE: taking full control of manufacturing Their strategy is partnership. Which is seen though JAC. 

This splits the risk and puts Nio in a safer financial position at the cost of vehicle margins. Remember when Nio was selling shit all cars last year? Yeah if they were fully integrated, it would have ruined the company because they would have to shoulder all the overheads that comes with running your own factory."
"They may use it to expand their partnership with JAC. As already confirmed, they will increase their production capacity with JAC to 5000 cars a month to accommodate increased demand. This doesn‚Äôt mean a new factory solely run by nio"
"Not sure what you are talking about? Can you elaborate more, thanks"
"On July 24th, Nio revealed the EC6 and option to pre-order.  The first 6,666 pre-orders come with a mystery box.

I am trying to find out if all mystery boxes have already been claimed (e.g., the 6,666 cars have sold already)."
Best way to find out is through Twitter or their other social media accounts
source for the mystery boxes?
What‚Äôs there to discuss? Sit back and enjoy the show next week
"I'll use this one as a daily discussion.  Whats a realistic 12 month price target that you all have for Nio?  I'm seeing anywhere from $7 to $112?  I'm planning on holding for 5 years or so, just wanted to know what you all think?  My cost average is about 4.71"
Could there be a chance that they won't do a monthly report? Do they do monthly reports every month or was it just a conincidence last month?
This will spike just over 13 then down to 9!
"Yeah, we've had some days with no posts again. When their is news, I will post discussion threads."
"In 5 years it could be way over 100, but it could also stay were it is now.. They just need to keep bringing good news and live up to their potential"
"They've done it every month this year so far.
Link [Nio IR news ](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases)"
ahh i see thank you for the fast response
"Xpeng recently got a bunch of cash... I dont think they will IPO anytime soon... maybe EOY or next year.

Also, xpeng is in a strategic alliance with NIO, so they doing good is beneficial too."
"I don‚Äôt believe in Li auto as it‚Äôs a hybrid gasoline and electric! Xpeng on other hand appears to be more compelling! I think as Nio investor, we should be ready for more and more competitions in market, it‚Äôs not going to be Nio and Xpeng, and Tesla only, soon enough other major car maker will follow along! 
I believe in Nio innovation and vision for future, battery as a service is example, Nio power will not be limited to Nio only, their patent about wireless charging hopefully will materialize into something cool.
In other words, you should not be in Nio if you only think it‚Äôs going to be monopoly!"
Personally not that into Xpeng since they have stolen from TSLA and much of the interior design is a direct copy. They will as a company be forever several steps behind being a copycat as opposed to an innovator.
[deleted]
Alliance in what way? I haven't really looked into Xpeng as much.
"Of course not, I'm looking at the grand scheme of things and competition is healthy. I'm looking at Xpeng and would love to invest aswell if they do become publicly tradable"
What makes you say that ?

It's a clone
China GDP growth was strong and NIO deliveries trending upwards all year.  If they hit another good number for July to keep the momentum going it should be good news for all of us.  Actual vehicle deliveries Is the most concrete thing in the EV market.  Beats Nikola‚Äôs phantom truck and LI‚Äôs meager sales by far.
Arnt they like a 1.5B market cap.. Nio is at 14B
I am one of those NIO long hopefuls. So excited for the boat to sail up... even slowly.
Its been slow. Like too slow. How did a new company post IPO have a share price higher than Nio. (Btw I am a total noob so please be easy on me).
Thank you man.
"Its the same with NIO, not all shares are traded, some are owned directly by Tencent, in the case for LI, some shares are owned by BABA. So the traded shares of LI is 95million BUT the total shares are closer to 1B.

Total Shares != Traded shares.

Im betting that the average retail investor doesnt know this, that is why the price is so high."
I‚Äôm trying to learn as much as possible about Li and Xpeng.  They seem like legitimate upstarts but NIO has a head start. They‚Äôre also each slightly different in terms of product.
I'd say that NIO has a much better future. We just have to be patient.
Because their market cap still could‚Äôve been below NIO. There is much more than just share price.
They‚Äôre market cap is similar to nio despite being selling half the cars and being hybrid - not pure ev
"I don‚Äôt think you have even looked at anything...

The market cap of Nio is 7x more than LI. Nio is 14.5 Billion and LI is 2.4."
"I have. LI's ipo price at 11.50 gave it a 9.6bn Market Cap\[1\]. Todays closing price gives it a Market Cap of 13bn\[2\]. Intraday Market cap gave it a valuation of 14.8bn.

\[1\] [https://www.iposcoop.com/ipo/li-auto/](https://www.iposcoop.com/ipo/li-auto/)

So no, its not 7x. Im not sure where you got your info from."
"People are investing in things they don‚Äôt understand, jumping on the hype train or riding the pump. When the dust settles (and it will) there will be a far more accurate indicator for where the market stands with their views on LI as a company and its products."
This
Monday hopefully
During first week of august
"They have been pushing then out sooner and sooner each time, most likely sometime during the first week."
NIO July Estimates posted here  look promising http://www.electricinvestor.com/2020/07/nio-july-2020-sales-estimates.html?m=1
probably during the weekend.
NIO Price Target $16 will be reached in a week according to https://www.electricinvestor.com/2020/08/nio-price-target-analysis-and-its-set.html?m=1
Beautiful
I‚Äôd rather have this than a Tesla. Amazing.
For those without Shazam - Tom Rosenthal is the artist.   Go Solo is the song.  I dig it.
Esthetic at it‚Äòs finest.
Yes!
I always wanted an Asian girlfriend like one in video!
Fuck I cried üò¢
Awesome. Thank you.
Aesthetic?
Me too
Yes :D Thank you for the correction.
"Looks to me like a competitor but I read that their cars also take fuel so are more like a hybrid then a pure electric vehicle.

It will be interesting to see how they and NIO perform in the coming months. I hope NIO is the right horse to back but I think there‚Äôs market share for both companies to exist. It also looks like Li Auto is targeting the same demographic as NIO (middle to upper middle class) and they have the same car model."
"Their fate is sealed. Hybrid fuel/electric vehicle is so early 2000's. This is not a true competitor to NIO or TESLA. Mark my words, they will need to pivot or die."
It is a hybrid car what is new?
[deleted]
Sleek exterior design
"This is going to be a real test for Nio! I think Nio can‚Äôt depends on being the only EV in market with Tesla to succeed, Nio vision is not only the cars, it‚Äôs the Nio power, others patents such as wireless charging.... I am still have faith in Nio to succeed, I hate when people says Nio success depends on Tesla or on fact they are only EV in market, competitions is coming from Li, eventually from Toyota, Ford and other auto maker!"
"Correct, they might be range extended EVs."
Close competitor to NIO just IPOd in the US. This is really the only other true competitor that is publicly traded other than Tesla.
"Maybe it's been trading on the Chinese stock exchange, but the US stock graph is like a day old and crashed after it's launch"
Clear pump and dump... kandi doesn't offer much in product value..
"No, I've held some shares of Kandi for almost a year now. Sold most this morning at $17. I bought at $2"
Agreed. I sold most my shares at $17 this morning.
"Interesting, my trading 212 app shows it to be like a day old"
Flex
"Are you thinking if LI which started trading this morning?

Edit: nevermind, i see trading 212 does show it as new"
Nope it's definitely Kandi. No idea why it shows up the way it does based on what you said
"Yeah, I see it too, odd."
Is r/li a subreddit?
"I've decided to pump a couple hundred quid into LI, but I do not expect them to thrive long term. I've done so much Nio research and I don't see a company that this late to the game competing. So I'm gonna offload my shares after a healthy increase (if that even happens).

This is largely personal sentiment, with a sprinkle of ""nio and Tesla will dominate the market"" sprinkled on top. Haven't actually extensively researched Li"
Its pretty pricey
I have r/LiAuto if r/Li is unavailable. Or r/Lixiang
"Any source for this? I hope it's true, surely will be great for revenue etc"
Yea let‚Äôs see some actual proof so we know you‚Äôre not apart of the LK coffee gang
"They really need to show number plates for these, otherwise it's just another photo in a Chinese location."
"https://m.weibo.cn/5647310207/4532192627132909

"Then this company is link to the CCP from this cases, I think I should sold all my shares now."
This is last year news
Why sell for this reason?
Thats solid indicator to buy more mate
"I have a bad experiences own fews China stock that  have relationship with CCP or Beijing :)
My worse stock is Beijing Blue Sky
And lately with the uncertain situation between US and China, I think I will put my investment more on US company ^^"
Its your choice. I put my bet on China. Its all about being on the winning side. Also it depends in what you invest. Small companies always is big risk - big reward no matter the country.
"Let see in the next 1-2 years what will happen, but my best bet so far is AMD 350% gain so far"
"had AMD, imo AMD is way overvalued atm. Very low profit compared to Intel or Nvidia"
I bought it 2 yrs back :) so far so good
"Yeah, still  overvalued as hell. Intel does 2x more cash flow in a single day, that AMD in 6 months. Basically AMD is not making any money and pretty sure its just a pump."
NIO has an office in munich since the very beginning and all their designs have been done there. Walked past their offices several times already since it's not far from my apartment.
"To add to this, Nio won the  'Best of Best award in exterior design' in Germany.  [https://www.chinapev.com/ev-2/nio/nio-es6-won-the-best-of-best-award-of-the-2020-german-automotive-brand-contest/](https://www.chinapev.com/ev-2/nio/nio-es6-won-the-best-of-best-award-of-the-2020-german-automotive-brand-contest/)"
[deleted]
Cleverer Schachzug von /nio wenn das f√ºr die DACH Region ist!?
None of those scream expansion to me. It sounds like the just need new people to run Nio's German social media accounts.
Munich... wrong location. Berlin is the place to be and Tesla knows it.
"They are already here, a few blocks away from my apartment. All their designs have already been developed in munich. Dunno exactly when they opened their offices here, but it must have been sometime around 2017.  
I hope germay is the place, but since Norway is way more into electric cars, maybe that would be the spot. BYD now starts there afaik, but I still hope germany will be first in europe. Since they have an office here already I guess it could well be."
"I agree, nice move."
Getmany has also the biggest competion
"Sie sind seit 2015 in Muc.  
""Man habe sich f√ºr M√ºnchen entschieden, sagt Hui Zhang, weil es das Zentrum der wichtigsten Automobilregion der Welt sei. BMW hat hier seine Zentrale, nach Ingolstadt zu Audi und nach Stuttgart zu Daimler und Porsche ist es nicht weit. M√ºnchen bot sich an, weil Nio die besten Designer anlocken wollte, manche von ihnen arbeiteten fr√ºher in der deutschen Autoindustrie, andere zogen aus Gro√übritannien her, wo sie fr√ºher bei Aston Martin t√§tig waren, oder aus Italien, wo sie Autos f√ºr Alfa Romeo oder Fiat entworfen haben. M√ºnchen bot sich aber auch an, weil Nio hier au√üerdem das Gesch√§ft mit seinen Zulieferern steuert, und die sind allesamt nah: ZF in Friedrichshafen, Schaeffler in Herzogenaurach, Bosch in Stuttgart, Infineon und Webasto vor den Toren M√ºnchens.""

"Why do you think berlin is better? Sure, munich is a bit more expensive but most the car manufacturer are located in southern germany. In bavaria we do have BMW and Audi. In Stuttgart there is Porsche and Mercedes Benz. Only thing you could argue is, you don't have too much direct competition right on your doorstep, but the automotive lobby sure is the biggest around bavaria and baden-wuerttemberg"
Why so. Jw?
"OK, I figured it out. They started in munich in 2015 and moved to the office I know in 2017 with 150 employees that time.Source (german, july 2017): [https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/das-deutsche-valley-muenchner-chic-1.3592717](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/das-deutsche-valley-muenchner-chic-1.3592717)Quote translated: ...The company from Shanghai, founded around 2 years ago, came to germany to develop the designs for their cars.

Later they moved into a mall in the old town, today they are located in Bogenhausen with almost 150 employees. ..."
">but most the car manufacturer are located in southern germany

Yes, the old ones.

>you don't have too much direct competition right on your doorstep

No, you have the biggest competitor in Berlin: Tesla.

&#x200B;

The difference between Berlin and Munich is about the same between electric and thermal autos."
"

Interesting info. They also have an office in London but are not currently recruiting. It's good to see they are seeking new employees in Germany"
"You didn't answer the question.  
The old ones had and have a big impact on Nio already. Former BMW employees work for them since 2015. They started small in munich but since 2017 they have an office with 150+ employees here, doing all the designs."
"London is their center for motor racing while the munich office is for car designs and orchestrating suppliers. Iirc more then 70% percent of the parts they use for their cars are from german manufacterer. Besides those offices and their head office in Shanghai, they also have an office in San Jos√© where their software gets developed."
"Munich is a nice move to expanding into Europe, no matter."
"Stop asking what the price will be in x or x days. Nobody knows. This is annoying as hell. Everything could happen even with the best news of the world for NIO. Macro, trump, covid, etc. 

Yeah you can expect it going up or down, but price is unpredictable. Keep holding. That's investment. If you want the quick buck, go trade with pennystocks.

If you want to really invest, keep for years and you'll most probably be rewarded. (well, except if it's in Nikola)."
How did you get that number? Not going to be an ass about it but do you have any source? Im really interested in knowing
July deliveries Aug 3
"I really like the ""Based on what I know.."" part. You are welcome to share the things you know about the deliveries, instead of just giving us a random number."
"I'm guessing $13 by weeks end. Got there briefly today but the support seems to be around $12.45 or so. Anticipation for these sales numbers, and the BaaS unveiling, should bump it up nicely. It's been super stable for the last two weeks which I think is good."
I hope people who make these posts get banned at some point
Did you pull that number out of thin air or?
5k plus according to http://www.electricinvestor.com/2020/07/nio-july-2020-sales-estimates.html?m=1
Any source?
I feel like former crypto investment community starts flooding into ev stocks...
Anyone who asks questions like ‚Äúwhat will the price be at‚Äù should go trade penny stocks. FACTS
I think he got the number from this really accurate website's estimations: [random.org](https://random.org)
Where did you find the date?
"Well, random.org gave me 4136 so he might be on to something..."
"Next monday, Nio usually release the delivery number as quick as they could, and monday will be good for stock"
I got 4336
Hmmm okay just looked at previous month and it ranged from 3rd to 10th
"I‚Äôm new here but isn‚Äôt this where I say, TO THE MOON BABY!!!!!!‚Äù?"
"Depends on how you're evaluating this... Do you mean in the world? Or in China?

Because if it's in China, there's 1.5 billion people and they're only starting to become wealthier as their GDP per capita goes up. When that goes higher, that will probably mean 50% of that 1.5 billion people are going to start looking at higher end vehicles.. 

So in my humble opinion, if there are multiple car companies in America, I can't see why that wouldn't apply in China...   


But to dominate the world, is any car company doing that right now? That's a fool's game to guess... but in the middle of that realization, i think Tesla and NIO has a good business model .."
"It wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if battery swapping and battery leasing becomes the norm for EV. I am sure Tesla will adopt this model as well. Battery rental is just a financing structure that Tesla can offer immediately if they want to. Charging stations work for now since only less than 1% of the cars on our streets are EV, but when that number goes up to 20-30%, charging stations are no longer a viable option. As fast as charging can get, it can‚Äôt beat the speed of battery swaps. Most people in the US, and more so in China,  don‚Äôt own houses where they can park and charge their cars in the garage for 8-10 hours. 
I think both companies can thrive together like Coke and Pepsi. Of course, Tesla being Coke as it‚Äôs the OG."
Equally is very unlikely.
"can, not sure if equally..."
"How many batter swap stations do they have in the US at the moment?  If 0 then I think competition in the US, will be hard."
"Can both businesses models prosper?


[There can be only one.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sqcLjcSloXs)

My money is on Connor Macleod."
"I will give you the benefit of the doubt, since I can‚Äôt prove anything. But I am curious, why bring in IP theft when there‚Äôs no supposed allegations against NIO for IP theft?"
"Nio is primarily Chinese, and couldn‚Äôt pass euro or NA safety standards, they probably have no interest anyways.  I think nio has its niche, Tesla is tapping into some of it.  But Tesla is also involved in multiple industries"
"Take my upvote. Just FYI, Coke is stolen from a Spanish drink. Totally stolen.

Coke, Alex Graham Bell, Einstein, Edison, Wright Brothers..... not until after WWII did the US start to take intellectual property seriously, the country is built on IP theft. One reason the criticisms of China in this regard are so outrageous."
"to get others view points, let me add the following. 

my understanding of the valuation of tesla is that it is based on the widespread adoption of EVs by asian markets. Battery swap seems more practical there and may give NIO a real edge. 

I don‚Äôt see a driver for Americans to adopt anything less than a really hardcore battery WITH the option to upgrade without buying a whole new car. The country is generally to vast."

"I am just a retired individual investor. I have recently bought NIO & am also looking at TSLA. Just the sharp reduction in EV Battery Costs per Kwh suggests to me that renting for a year & then checking prices is a no brainer decision that is likely to be preferred by customers if offered to them.

Also if you cannot afford a 100 kwh battery then you can rent a 70 kwh battery & hope the 100 kwh falls in price in a year. Perhaps even wait for a 120kwh or higher capacity battery. Also if you can buy the EV & rent the battery your initial costs may substantially lower your initial investment suggesting that at least for the Chinese market the Battery Swapping Model may ultimately dominate. 

In USA & Europe the existing Car Dealer infrastructure offers a potential for Nationwide Battery Swapping centers & would give Auto Makers a chance to hit back on TSLA. For example Ford starts to selll NIO EV Vehicles plus their own EVs & introduces Battery Swapping at their dealerships. I wonder if the NIO 1200 EV Battery Patents also cover Battery Swapping as currently used by NIO  So overall I think the market will move to Battery Swapping which may be a business model risk not yet fully appreciated in the TSLA Market Cap."
"I‚Äôm just wondering why they haven‚Äôt entered the market in the US and thought there must be some regulations in place.  If they did study the auto market here, they would probably have commercials on tv by now.  Do they have commercials airing in the states?"
I believe the Hype of owning a Tesla is minimal compared to the USA. Chinese consumers are much more diligent in wanting high quality and high end. NIO is their baby and they will nurture it.
"Well... to most people having to use an ipad to find fan speeds etc can be/seem very hard at first specifically while driving. Until you use the product(model 3 owner) and realize that you actually drive on autopilot +90-95% of the time specifically at hwy speeds. Its really not that hard. 

IMO its like saying I need the blackberry keys to type.. until you dont. 

I am certain there will be cars for everyone.. but once you get used to the ipad look.. other cars just seem very outdated."
"As far as I‚Äôm aware, TSLA currently all but owns the self-driving segment and that technology alone can demand a premium. 

Often investing in an EV means also investing in a robust home charging system which can be a steep burden of entry for the mid-tier market. 

Improving nonfunctional interior/exterior aesthetics will hardly shift the needle at this point when the real value is being first to market with usable, reliable tech. 

TSLA will inevitably have to shift its focus as the market matures, but for now they‚Äôre in a sweet spot."
NIO has air suspension.  All around NIO destroys Tesla. NIO will prove itself as a valid competitor
"TSLA has to sacrifice quality control in the name of # of cars made per quarter. Repairing minor defects is not a major concern for the investors who only care about sales growth. TSLA is rated the worst by JD Power and old Tesla repairs are a real nightmare that hasn‚Äôt been addressed by Elon. 

If NIO can manage to implement their Chinese experience to the EU and US, selling high quality luxury experience  as opposed to Tesla ‚Äòs cool high-tech vibe, they can have a real competitive advantage. It doesn‚Äôt have to be better in battery capacity or speed, as long as the user experience is superior to Tesla. We can see how the Apple IPhones can get away with mediocre internals and charge premium prices because the whole ownership experience is just so much better than buying an Android."
"True there are quality issues with Tesla but please realize that‚Äôs also going to be the most vocal segment of the owners. Majority of the Tesla owners, myself included had no issues with the build or the purchasing experience. 
It is the best car I have owned and the easiest purchase experience. It is also the most expensive car I have ever owned, so I have no bases to compare it with other luxury cars. 
I think the tech and the driving experience is what make the Tesla special, it makes people who normally do not buy luxury cars stretch buy. This opens up a bigger audience for ownership."
"  ...And then you realise the Ec6 is being sold for $52,441 and actually comes with a knob to change the fan direction instead of having to find a specific area buried in the settings menu of the ""advanced"" dashboard screen.

I honestly think Tesla's software and battery tech is second to none but the company has become yet another over hyped American company. The software and battery tech is great but if the build quickly of their cars is like this then surly they can't justify a $60,000 price. for that price you could get:

Audi SQ5, 

Mercedes-Benz ML-Class, 

Audi A6, 

BMW 4 Series, 

Lexus GX 460

Now obviously those aren't EV's but you get the gist, cars at a similar price point have a wayy better build quality and unless Tesla step their game up, the allure of its self driving tech and fully electric capabilities will only last so long before consumers start realising that once you scratch below the surface a little, the Tesla fundamentally right now inst that good of a car.

For someone based in the EU, if NIO start selling over here, eventually i can see them easily becoming the better car to buy if they can improve their battery swapping tech/efficiency and their software i.e self driving (which they are developing right now).

I think Tesla's saving grace up t this point has been their lack of competition. But now that others are getting serious about EV's, it could mean hard times ahead for Tesla. Until they up their build quality, their brand image will be what helps them to continue to sell cars over their nearest competitors.

Thoughts?

EDIT: Even the Polestar 2 (Owned and produced by Volvo) is priced in at $59,900 and has an vegan, natural interior and based on what reviewers have said, its built very well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmplk52fznQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmplk52fznQ)"
"That's a good point but i still feel like they didn't need to go quite so extreme on the minimalism side of things. But like you said, people got used to the iphone without its keyboard so who knows."
"I don‚Äôt agree cuz my family members including myself have bmw and Lexus and Mercedes, yes great build quality but once we bought a Tesla, no one wanted to drive the others.  Currently looking to buy another Tesla."
"Solid post. I believe that the only challenge in expansion to EU will be how their customers perceive chinese brands. In my assumption, it is on the below average side. I think NIO has done a good job of branding as a premium EV in China, which is the most important market, but for international expansion I am unsure of the customer market in Europe and how they perceive Chinese brands so NIO may need another catalyst outside of quality to increase their brand in EU. I‚Äôve read that lots of Europeans buy chinese smartphones so that‚Äôs a positive sign that this can be improved"
"Buried in a settings menu? Hardly. 

I own stock of both of these companies, and disparaging one with false information does a disservice to both.

Edit: Actually drive a Tesla and you‚Äôll come away impressed. The driving dynamics and tech are what pull customers in."
"üéØ all these naysayers need to get behind a Tesla and drive it.  

Just yesterday I had a middle aged person who test drove the Y after driving BMWs and Lexuses their whole life. He was FLOORED, and wants one now.  

He was a little annoyed when he said ""man you never told me how quick and stable these things are??!! It's incredible!"""
"I'm based in the UK and i see lots of people using Huawei phones even after it's negative 5g news. I think the recent human right violations of the Uyghurs has been less than positive for Chinese brands in the eu/west,  but it also feels like it should include the likes of Apple as they build their iphones there.

Volvo is owed by a Chinese company and their cars are built in China. People still buy Volvo's in the UK and they're known to be well made, long lasting cars that won't let you down. Obviously Volvo was originally Swedish so that probably helps with their brand image. However, seeing their performance after their Chinese takeover,  I think this proves China does have what it takes to be a big player in the world of car brands.

 I like that there's links with Volkswagen due to JAC Motors manufacturing NIO's current lineup of cars and think this link with Volkswagen could prove beneficial when they try to introduce cars into the EU market through Germany?

I also like that they've been operating their NIO Formula E Team for some time now. Not only will that help them to get their brand into the public eye of the west, but it also helps to give them credibility when they're competing in the same sport as Mercedes, BMW and other well known and liked car brands. I know lots of Motorsport fans who know of NIO through formula e solely. When they start selling cars to these markets, this brand recognition should help them as they won't be seen as a completely unknown, out of nowhere brand like i think xpeng motors would.

Obviously like you said, right now NIO find themselves in the very fortunate position of being based in a country with 1.4 billion people and with a rapidly growing middle class. They aren't under the pressure that other ev brands are under whereby they will need to expand quickly to other countries/markets in order to grow and meet sales numbers. Logically speaking NIO seem to be in a very good position right now and the next thing to be seen is if they are actually able to live up to expectations."
"Downvote OP for distributing hoax. If you‚Äôre reading this post and wonder if it‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs not.  I have checked OP‚Äôs past records on Reddit and he has been bashing NIO and trying to get karma by posting on r/freekarma4u"
"Nio doesn‚Äôt yet sell small sedans, you can‚Äôt be comparing the price of their 7 seater SUVs to the price of a model 3."
"source? Obviously the standard model 3/Y is differently placed than the NIO products. You can rather compare to the longrange/performance models, these will not be produced in Shanghai but rather in Freemont and will remain much more expensive"
Can we bring that to the US please? I'd buy that.
to compete against Han of BYD

lol wtf
Seems like an honest review from an owner. I found it informative. Thanks for sharing! I currently own a Tesla. I wish they had adopted the battery swap technology instead of abondoning it. This definitely gives Nio a leg up on the competition.
"An awesome review. I had no idea about all the small features that this car has. I have always loved Tesla's, they've become 'that' car that I would stare at when it drove past, but this review seriously made me want a NIO car. They clearly understand their Chinese community as well, will be interesting if they continue the NIO Housing if they expand to Europe and Europe, as in my opinion, the western world is less fussed about being a community, everybody does their own thing - but it is clearly a thing the Chinese culture value and they understand that. Future looks bright. A Blue Sky is Coming.

&#x200B;

\*Tried to be unbiased, but the video didn't show any real faults to the car. Overall cool review."

"Last thing Americans are going to buy something Chinese made is a $50,000+ SUV dude. Shit is not selling in US and saying that as an investor. The car will sell in Asia and EU that‚Äôs about it."
"In 1980 would you have guessed a Japanese car would be the number one seller in the United States for the next generation? It would take time, but it‚Äôs not impossible. The blatant rip offs of GM suvs are selling fine for Kia."
"I agree 100%. I am 20k invested in Nio, so I have a bias - but even I am not blinded to the fact that China‚Äôs reputation to overcome is going to take a generation or two. Very very few would spend luxury car money on it, even if it is worth it in reality."
That‚Äôs a huge market.
"Acura RDX and MDX 
ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
Just saying"
Japan isn‚Äôt a country that was even remotely close to threatening US‚Äô hegemony on the world stage. China is. US is going to churn out anti-chinese propaganda at speeds you‚Äôve never seen before.
"I agree that it is hard to rebrand the term, made in China, as a luxury brand. It would not sell well in America as a luxury brand, but I believe it still can compete there as an EV and have a small market share.

Problem is it would not have all the bell and whistles without China's ecosystem, Nio's app & house, swapping station, etc. You would probably have to pick a larger battery to compensate in America.

As an EV, from the video review, I would definitely choose it over Tesla, still gotta test drive it tho. But this is coming from someone who doesn't care about branding.

I can see it succeeding in China because it is definitely trying to become the Apple brand in China with its ecosystem and lifestyle marketing. No one can predict the future so we will see."
"just that its not luxury in price, but in quality and with respect to features"
"> but even I am not blinded to the fact that China‚Äôs reputation to overcome is going to take a generation or two.

In some sense I agree, but Tesla isn't exactly known for build-quality either. So if I was choosing between Nio and Tesla I wouldn't be basing it on that metric since neither has a good reputation."
Do you think US hegemony has another 100 years?
Ok Chinese cabbage. I personally want one idc if they want to spy on me. There's many quality Chinese products that you probably own.
Sure if the US plays it‚Äôs cards right. It has a bipartisan support and ASEAN countries support.

"I agree, he is a great CEO. He is one of the main reasons why I invested with NIO. With this guy at the helm bigger and better things will continue for many years with this company."

"B4 September 2021, safe."
"as 4 Trump, not sure after Nov.3, 2020"
"The Chinese gov basically doesn't allow PCAOB to conduct the audits, and from the administration's POV, that is the issue regardless of whether or not a Chinese firm's financials are accurate.  In 2018, however, the PCAOB was on the administration shortlist to disband because it was perceived as being slow, ineffective, etc.  Same time, this issue has been a point of contention since 2013 when Chinese firms were first listed.  While Chinese firms account for 3 or 4% of US stock exchange market cap, or about $1.5T, Trump is looking for a scapegoat for his ineptitude, and seems uninterested in backing off since he seemingly wants to look tough on China and blame them for the virus and the economy and whatever else he can roll in with them. For members of Congress, they may be forced to support the initiative or risk being labeled soft on China, if it gets to a vote in the house.  He cut off China from the Fulbright program and Peace Corp missions recently as well.  American multinationals are not happy, because they don't want to lose the business opportunities in China.  But this isn't about what is rational, it's all about his ego and being a poor negotiator and throwing a temper tantrum.  So I wouldn't put it past him, despite that I think escalating this thing is really bad for the economy.  Until it's sorted out and we get adults in charge again in 2021 I think listed Chinese stock will be subdued.  Oh, and the Chinese exchanges represent around $12T market cap, but most American brokerages don't give investors a direct way to invest.  So if delisting does occur, followed by a move to Hong Kong exchange, there's a much smaller pool of capital bidding for shares, which hurts the Long term nio case.  Situation sucks.  I think NIO has a big future and I want a piece of it, but I am sick of being burned by Trump's ego."

Haven't sold any of them. Target $90 in 3 years. I saw a Ballie Gifford analysis which suggested a $300 market cap in 10 years, roughly $300 per share. Stock has to grow $30 per year every year to meet their target. If we land right on $90 in 3 years we will be ""right on schedule"" according to Ballie Gifford. In reality I think NIO will have some dilution, more debt, and some political risk, so would be happy to get to $75 in 3 years instead."

Tesla‚Äôs are single and dual motors depending on the model.  The cyber truck has a tri motor coming out.  There is a rumored tri motor Model X.

I think Teslas are all dual motor as far as I can tell.

""" The best of the 2020 rally in NIO stock has already happened. ""

Pretty confident that this won't be true."

To me his assumptions *seem* okay but they seem to conveniently prove his thesis.  Adjust one or two of them just a little and you could tell a very different story.
way undervalued
"Good news, just have to get past these geopolitical tensions."
I am kind of worried that China also shut down US consulate in Chengdu in response of Chinese consulate shut down in Houston.  And NIO is dropping.
Go NIO!!

Bin Li is the man
Why? NIO doesn‚Äôt sell in US
"This was expected, eye for an eye. China isn't going to let US bully it."
Because of day trading. I've 30k invested in NIO and I faith in it.
Because it's listed in the US.
I invested at 13.5 and it immediately plummeted. I just can't catch a break with knowing when to buy in... Put all I had lying around in too so can't even buy the dips xD
Fair enoughüëç. I‚Äôve only got ¬£350 invested in them but they‚Äôre taking a heavy hit at the moment
"What does that have to do with anything? You realize that the more listings the US has in their stock market, the wealthier the US gets right? 

That‚Äôs why China thew a tantrum when BABA listed on US instead Chinese markets. US isn‚Äôt going to delist it for no reason, even if there was a war.

In fact, you‚Äôd see China pressuring NIO to delist first but in that case NIO would probably just relocate to Singapore, this has happened before with other companies."
"what do you think it will look like in 1, 3, 5 years from now? maybe time in market is a bit short..."
Wouldn‚Äôt worry about it. Everything is down.
"Delisting is a threat because of the white house's current, petty occupant.  I wouldn't put it past him to issue an eo.  If it isn't listed on the us exchanges, there will be a smaller pool of investors."
"Yeah, I'm a long term investor so I'm not too concerned and think it'll be fine eventually. Just sucks knowing I could've got another 15% if I had waited 1 day"
"The only thing he cares about is the stock market and the economy, I highly highly doubt he‚Äôd do it for no reason. That would benefit only China and he isn‚Äôt going to have that.

Your fear is irrational. There is no threat of delisting unless NIO is cooking their books."
"The issue isn't NIO cooking the books.  The PCAOB is the group tasked with auditing the books of publicly traded companies, and although PWHC oversees Zhong Hain (the Chinese auditor that does NIO's books), neither the PCAOB nor as I understand it are PWHC allowed direct access to the books, because that information is considered a state secret by the Chinese government, which would make them noncompliant per the terms of the proposed legislation.  So while Trump is primarily concerned with the stock market, he also started a trade war that arguably harmed the markets, and certainly tanked a previous holding of mine.  We're expected to get official guidance on the matter in early August, which would lead to a potential legislative action.  Being an election year, it could easily pass in the house, having unanimously passed the Senate, etc..."
"If there‚Äôs anyone who knows how to mass produce, it‚Äôs the chinese."
Scale matters as NIO closing in TSLA amid Upper-middle-class buyers who know how to get the most from their hard-earned money.
"If I heard some information correctly, the subsides are only for cars with quick replaceable  batteries. Tesla does not have this. So do they not qualify for the subsidies ? If that‚Äôs the case. Tesla needs to change their whole model in China or they‚Äôre gonna get destroyed. Imagine that."
"Slow down cowboy! You can not subtract the cumulative delivery number from the production number to arrive at the July number. Production always runs ahead of delivery. Fact has been that production volume is capped at 4k per month, so it‚Äôs unlikely deliveries can be much higher if any higher than 4,000 in July and August. Production volume is expected to increase by 25% to 5k around the September, which means delivery will still be below 5k in September.  The good news is that if demand remains strong, it‚Äôs likely that JAC / NIO will invest in greater capacity soon afterwards, especially with a sedan early next year."
Well said
Can you explain what you mean? I‚Äôm brand new to stocks and Nio
"Also with Battery Technology as with all technology -- Product will get better and cheaper. So replaceable batteries which you can rent or lease seems the smart way forward. For TSLA to change to that model is not that easy. They are already big time committed on the Model Y. NIO can offer EC6 as low as RMB 250,000 excluding battery. Compare that with Model Y at RMB 488,000 Also with current tensions the Chinese may prefer local brand which is as luxurious & perhaps even a little more spacier. Exciting times ahead. Musk is a legend in US but not guaranteed winner versus NIO in China. Legend of Elon Musk will not deter Ma Huateng who is a senior member of CCP plus being the richest man in China & the Govt. of China in trying to stop EV sales being dominated by US Tesla"
"This is a realistic expectation with what we know.
However, I‚Äôm in agreement with OP that NIO ought to focus on increasing production capacity to at least 10K monthly soon, especially if they look towards expansion to Europe / US next year. Hell, even just in China itself a 10K scale up monthly would help them further win the domestic market. Sooner rather than later is better if they can maintain the quality of the product and after service economy."
"If you are new to stocks, I suggest reading the annual report. Most people do not. The annual report outlines all the risks and opportunities in detail. After you read it you will truly realize most people‚Äôs lack of knowledge and will be much further ahead than most."
"If you Google news on the onging Cheng Du EV Shows, you will find plenty intel on the EV trends globally, and NIO has its place, there are some sepcs and post sale services are interesting, like life long battery warranty, interchanglbe batteries services, etc. 

NIO's SUV offerings are very popular amid Chinese IT professionals or middle class + , for example, EV has zero cost of a new car plate, but usually a gas burning car would reqire a car plate for a sum of USD 20,000 to control the pollusion."
"One more thing, I see EV compmay as basically a software company+ batteries+ 5G triggered IOT in the next 3-5 years, with TSLA kind of scale, anyone can follow that format will be a winner, and the planet only allows only a few of them. Call it new capitalism. 
Those in my watch list are
NIO, BYD, Xiao Peng and Li Xiang, besides TSLA. 
Wish a nice weekend."
"Thanks. I know a bit about EV as, until this morning, Nio was my only stock (bought 5 shares of Microsoft earlier today to have something more stable/less volatile) and I‚Äôve read recent news coming out. I‚Äôll google the annual report tomorrow. Here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôve probably spent more on shares of Nio than I can afford to lose. It feels like I‚Äôm gambling at times. I bought 10 shares today at $10.99. That‚Äôs the last I‚Äôll be spending. I now own 311 shares at an average price of $12.51. I‚Äôd like to hold onto it for a few years but I assume a lot of people are looking to make a quick buck, which is why the stock plummets every time it goes up. How do I know when it‚Äôs time to cut my losses or pull the plug?

Last time I invested in a small company was in like 2015. It was this company that made unbreakable glass and Apple was going to be using their technology. The stock kept going up until Apple announced it would be used for the Apple Watch but not the phone. I had to sprint out of a meeting to my computer to sell and didn‚Äôt lose quite as much as I would‚Äôve had I stayed. I just don‚Äôt want that to happen again.

I don‚Äôt know anything though. I just learned what bulls and bears are. Avg. volume, volume, all that shit means nothing to me"
"Investing into any individual company carries more risk than investing into a passive and very diversified index fund. 

I understand the worry about people wanting to make a quick buck (and it's a perfectly reasonable thing to do), but this has been the case for any stock that has ever existed. Look at the long term chart for TSLA, you will see large peaks from years ago where people took a quick buck - now look at it! This is not to say the same will happen with NIO , NIO is a young company that's had cash flow issues until being bailed out recently.

If you are feeling like it's gambling you are probably investing above your risk tolerance, There's a good saying when it comes to investing - ""Diversify or die"""
"I remember I once made 2000 dollars overnight on some stem cell stocks but my colleague was angry that I can make that easy money.

Chance to make double or triple money out of NIO is the time when it releases L4, reached 5K production/month, it will take a few months.

NIO basically also follows the TSLA trend.

There is a risk to delisting give the current ACT given bad China-American politics though, you need to follow all the mentioned development.

"It might go lower, it might not.

The entire EV sector more or less follows tesla. 

Nio will release July sales figures in a few weeks, so that is a potential catalyst.

You should do some research on them before investing and asking whether to buy nio on the nio subreddit on reddit is not proper dd."

I‚Äôd buy

"Any cheaper and the brand will no longer be a coveted luxury item. NIO understands the market it‚Äôs targeting. However I have doubts if the 100kwh model is going to sell well, since Chinese cities are more dense than American cities and people drive fewer km in a year."
"I'm a little disappointed that its not cheaper, I guess this puts in at about the same price as ES6."
Why no 84kWh? Is that still a thing?
That 0.9 second gap would cost me 100k rmb? U rarely need that since the traffic in China is not nice at all.

I asked this question a few days back. The consensus here is that it's highly unlikely, but its r/Nio so its pretty much an echochamber (no hate to this sub, its just the character of such a subreddit), so might want to do your own research too."
"It's a legit concern.  I sold out when it dropped below $15 last Monday in the upper $14's, and with the US China geopolitical tension ramping up, haven't been in a hurry to re-enter.  As long as Trump is the petty, vindictive POS he's shown himself to be for the entirety of his public life, I think it is entirely possible he'll tire of waiting for congress to act, especially now that he wants a new enemy to divert attention from his garbage handling of covid19 and the US economy, and issue an executive order delisting Chinese stocks.  Meantime, I think with how Tesla gamed credits to achieve ""profitability"" we'll see some EV bubble deflation, plus the economic outlook being so weak will probably push a good number of us investors to cash or other forms of risk off.  Not a bad thing necessarily, but it means I am expecting to see $9 before I see $20."
"Till next Spet 2021, NIO is not a concern on 3 years bar in the Act. 

Baba? It is also listed in HK, and you can buy over there, Baba PE is 31, not mentioning it holds 33% of ANT, which will IPO in dual markets of Shanghai and HK as planned, a sized of 200 billion. 

I own both Baba and NIO

"It makes sense to have battery rental options, for example say I use my car 90% time in the city where I need less then 200 miles of range. I don't need buy the large battery pack version of my car for an extra $15k when I don't use that. I can then just swap out my battery and rent  the bigger battery for when I road trip."
game changer
I want a NIO so bad..... I believe in NIO and have invested so much.
Wow!
Yes. smart move.
"BAAS makes more sense for dense urban areas (most of the chinese cities where most of their consumer base will reside/work). As most of these locations do not have L1 or L2 chargers at their work or residential parking spots.

&#x200B;

The local range vs the weekend daytrip range is another issue.  The key is to lower initial cost to get more nio cars on the road."
"According to Chjnese news, this is what Google translates: NIO launched a battery rental program that allows car owners to purchase batteries in installments. The minimum price of NIO's entry-level model ES6 has dropped from 358,000 yuan to 258,000 yuan. or USD 368,570. (cheaper, better.)"
Battery swaps are only necessary if you are on a long trip and need a full charge fast. For daily drives less than 200 miles you simply charge your car overnight. Level 2 charging will also soon be commonplace in parking lots in the next five years which will eliminate the edge-cases where people live in the city and do not have access to overnight charging - they'll just charge at work instead.
200 miles is 321.87 km

Battery changer
The existing program is a pilot project. But now NIO is planning to institutionalize this facility by setting up a dedicated battery asset management company that will be led by NIO Energy.
Got the comma in the wrong spot on your USD valuation

Is that still part of the umbrella company of NIO inc ?
"Just to add on, this has not been confirmed yet though. Came out as rumour based on a Chinese site citing source from employee. Catl (current battery supplier) interested to invest in this new subsidiary."
Yes. The new company will be led by NIO Energy which is a subsidiary.
"From what [I am reading, ](https://marketrealist.com/2020/07/baas-next-big-killer-for-nio-stock/) this will be a separate entity. Why else would they be looking for financing only for that?"
"Analysts are paid to be wrong, they simply write what benefits them."
Anytime they do people say it‚Äôs biased and untrue. I don‚Äôt think honestly this group wants analysts coverage at this point. Past quarter numbers are trash and that‚Äôs what people have to go off. The speculation on ‚Äúpossibilities‚Äù is not what analysts go off. My .02
Why?? I think GS did a bang up job last week!!
"Goldman are doing a great job. Accumulate now while they are doing their thing. Why do you want this stock to have people piling in? It's going to be worth a fortune in due course. Let the Chinese car buyers drive it up, not analysts paid to shape the BS financial media narrative."
"If you‚Äôre willing to go long. - Despite the hype, the stock price is unlikely to shift dramatically one way or the other in the immediate future. 

Long term looks favorable for a variety of factors, but the EV space is tight and getting tighter as the wider market leans into green energy. XPENG, TSLA, BYD, etc. are all strong competitors vying for market share."
"Yes, sell your car and your house and put it into nio. I did and now I 3x‚Äôed my original investment but I‚Äôm homeless"
Yes. As much money as you have currently will suffice. Thank you for your sacrifice.

Yes
Buy if you going long term!
"Drip in over the next six months or so.  I caught lightning and turned $350k into $700k a few weeks ago, but I think it will be a slow steady grind to ___ once the market bottoms again.

"I'm curious as to what this means to NIO. Will it be a parent company to the new battery asset management company, or is this a complete separation? Thus our current investments in NIO will essentially be separated from the future of BAAS?"
"That‚Äôs awesome, but why does Nio has to be a Tesla Killer? EVs should be replacing gas cars, there‚Äôs plenty of market to share. In the current environment, when Tesla is doing well, Nio is doing well too :)"
huge if true
The battery lease program has been there for quite some time. 100K RMB off if you choose to lease.
That's $33980.10 for a ES6. Cheaper then the $35K off the menu Model 3.  7K cheaper then a Model y
NIO IS HEADING TO THE MOON. I'M A NIO INVESTOR. NIO IS MY TICKET TO BEING A SELF MADE MILLIONAIRE.

This is not the Battery as service program. NIO will release it sometime later this year
"This is still priced largely as a luxury service, the price variance is unlikely to deter potential end-users."
"You still have to pay for the battery by leasing, do you know what the lease estimated price if you to keep the car for 5 years? 
and I don‚Äôt think this will be a Tesla killer ‚ÄúI am not a TSLA investor‚Äù"

"Saw a few in my Mother's communit. it's auto pilot is next best yo TSLA. SUV price performance. its new battery strategy intetesting. Got bank loan to build its own factory to reach the scale thst it currently is lack of. 

still many other competitions like Xiao Peng 7 and BYD Han (5G)"
"One more thing, NIO SUV  is at middle class plus, mostly IT professional, their fan club is really loyal, who actually help sales."
"Pretty common car in Suzhou/Shanghai. Battery swap sometimes has annoyingly long queues (at worst 30-40 minutes), but amazing when you can swap and directly go: 400km in 3 minutes for free. Nio Houses are amazing and great communities, sometimes you open the door with your app and it feels clever. Feels like a very professional brand. Car is of good build quality too. Just a Tesla but then an SUV."
"was in Beijing last Dec when nio was in deep trouble, I saw es6/8 pretty much every day."
Sounds promising but why are the queues that long ? Because of the car being common and too little swap stations or bad management? (Bad schedule? id like to think you can chose a day and time where you‚Äôd like a swap as simple as any appointment. Since the process should be few minute swap each customer in and out - easy to calculate and reduce waiting times)
"The swap takes 3-4 minutes. If there's 5 cars waiting, that's quickly 25 minutes. And sometimes the batteries in storage also need charging. Think about rush hour or Friday evening. The problem is that people don't charge at home, so lot of people need battery swapping every few days for daily commute."
Great news! Thank you.
Why do you guys feel the need to be a ‚ÄúTesla killer‚Äù or even want that? Competition is good for business.
"Their push for battery swapping and wireless charging is what gives me faith over Tesla for the future.

We are creatures of habits and this is more what we are used to, filling up at a station (replaced by battery swapping) at no more than 10 - 15mins, vs no matter the fast charging, still needs more than 30mins.

Extra bonus, park it for battery swap, pick up milk and flowers before going home."
How do they have a patent on battery swapping. How can swapping a battery be patented?
Because most everyone here is a Robinhood investor who put their life savings into NIO and want it to moon.
"Its easier to build a small station to charge a car, than a garage size place that has batteries. I'm still not 100% sold on battery swap. At least here in the U.S... I think it's great, 3-4 minutes for a full charged battery? Sign me up. but how can this scale?"
"Food for thought till we see how they impliment it in China. From their design of the building, it's literally a 20feet container. These can be trucked and dropped on location, so I don't see the scaling being a showstopper compared to stations.

These stops can literally be parked in parking area, commercial sites or driven up road side service stations."
"Hahaha Tesla desperate... OK it's NIO sub and we all support them but please let's stay serious a bit!

NIO ""wants to be"" Tesla not the other way around."
"So far, NIO has far superior customer service and will have a much higher retention of customers."
"Sorry but so far you/we have no clue about it because we have literally no data for NIO to compare it to Tesla.

Also NIO has barely sold 50k so far. 

Back to my initial comment, let's keep it real please."
"Did Tesla give any reason for reducing the Deposit Fee to RMB 1,000? Will be interesting to see how orders& interest go for EC6 at Chengdu Show"
"Like the Cybertruck is only 1000 in whatever the customer's currency is, I would say that they just don't need the money anyway on their books anymore.

1000 is enough to make it a ""serious"" reservation, not like a NKLA one for example."
Yep... another patent and step ahead of other ev

"Tesla with that net income profitability for 4 quarters despite the Fremont factory being shut down for the majority of the year proves a lot of demand for electric vehicles both in the U.S and China. 

Tesla showing that electric vehicles are the future and that benefits Nio tremendous."
I definitely agree. Tesla's blowout numbers for the 2nd qtr of 2020 validate everything Nio is trying to do.
"July numbers are going to be good, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. If you look closer in the financial reporting TSLA made heavy use to the tune of \~400 million on regulatory credits to offset the financial impact of covid in order to meet profitability for this quarter. A shrewd and warranted action on their part (saved for a rainy day, and this qualifies).. but to echo other sentiment, NIO still needs to push hard for our printed tendies! Tesla has validated and paved the way... now we need execution.

Keep an eye on escalating China-US relations and policies, as well as production scaling ramp up."
Does anyone know when are their financial results out?
Let‚Äôs not go crazy. We need the Chinese government to push NIO hard!
Agreed man.
"100% , thank you for the insight!"
"The credits might have made them profitable.. but what would the qtr look like if they were not in a pandemic.. the comparison should be when Ford/GM report significantly worse results and substantial loss's next week. I am pretty sure they could have pushed 130-140k deliveries and made a profit despite the credits. Time will tell on this one. This is all great news for NIO as well to follow thier lead and get support. 

ICE should take notice that while they blinked Tesla will have 4 plants in three regions by 2021.."
"TSLA is already out , NIO sept"
Its up 3% after Tesla's report
"Holy shit, Tesla turned a profit."
Jesus it's been a week go up already
NIO TO THE MOON.
TSLA dropping it‚Äôs new order reservation fee in China will definitely be a counter-weight to any anticipated upswing in NIO‚Äôs share price. TSLA has realized the goldmine that is the growing EV market is in China and is certainly willing and able to compete with domestic manufacturers.
Hopefully it continues. I think it will.

on carbon offset credits yes"
"If you follow Elon on twitter, you would have known today was going to be a good day. He trolls when its good."
üòÖ I know right? I guess I was wrong about it  going up today.
Yeah that will help tesla. If I were living in china I would still choose nio because of the battery swap teck. They all live in high rises and that's going to be a very powerful motivator for nios sales.
While concerning I don't think that this  actually impacts too greatly towards NIO for the interim since they sell only to the local Chinese market.

Just give it time. You can only ignore success for so long. I think this company will be on a lot of radars by the end of the year.
"Relax, this is short term news. Panicking is not a trait for an investor, outgrow it."
why is this bad? doesn‚Äôt increased tensions further the concept of NIO becoming the Chinese Tesla?
"First of all, it‚Äôs unlikely, they‚Äôll probably get away with it. And secondly, tied to your own country is okay for the time being, they do have the largest population after all - and a government rapidly encouraging EVs."

"It appears these analysts don‚Äôt see the full potential of the EV market. As early entrants, most of these producers will become very profitable either by themselves or by merging with others."
"What are peoples thoughts for Nio today? I personally think it will follow a similar pattern as to yesterday, as I assume Tesla will rise in the later day, due to Tesla's announcements tomorrow? And Nio seems to have similar market behaviour to Tesla."
Rumor says EC6 will be more expensive than ES6
"Never heard of XPENG until today, OMG the cars look sexy!!! Nio seems like a casual car maker and XPENG seems to be aimed towards luxury looking o:"

 [u/brad4711](https://www.reddit.com/user/brad4711/) can you do similar one for Nio?"
"Ah ok, makes sense, thanks üëç"
"You need a strategy and an investment plan for each individual position, as well as your overall portfolio."
"Nobody tricked you, they gave their opinion.

You made the call to sell thinking that it was the good move based on your knowledge.

Own your shit, stop putting the blame on other people.

Like when you make profits, your bad calls are yours & nobody forced you to it. Learn from it and move forward."
"You identified your mistake. You listened to ""people that tricked you"". I've been there before, because I listened to someone months ago talk about NIO and the potential ...Then made my bet. 

I also heard the people last Friday start panicking and start selling. Not me. If you believe in NIO just ask yourself is it too late? We all know why it nose-dived Friday. Now we know it was all BS. Good luck brother."
"Never listen to Reddit. Rule 1. Do your own shit and if someone agrees to your opinion, nice.

If not, try and find out if their reasoning is better.

And just hold."
"Why wasn't your thought to hold and buy in more if it tanked to $8-9 instead? Your confidence, understanding of the value opportunity, and goals all were not clear enough and you panic sold the moment you were tested. Do the proper due diligence before you play with your hard earned cash."
"Man it's okay to trade this stock (I did it) I bought it sold it and bought it again at the same price! It's volatile enough, but not to the extent of what people were telling you. However, don't get too greedy, I think that's the key here , set a target for your profit and start selling some of your position, people here saying 100 dollars or 50 is a bit crazy too.. sure long term but there a lot of volatility you can take advantage of in the mean time if you want to be more active. If not, then buy at a reasonable price even 13 is decent tbh, and hold for a long long time. Good luck man, it's okay, it sucks but you learned."
"Why the hell are you making decisions that affect thousands of dollars of *your money* just because some strangers on the internet said the stock would move a certain way? Don't be mad at people you feel ""tricked you"" because you're the one who decided to believe them. Do you believe Nio will grow to be a serious contender in the auto industry in the next 5-10 years? Buy. Hold. Buy more. Keep holding. Don't touch it. Your trades should span months or years years, not days."
"Don't ever listen to other people. You should not care what other people say. Many hate Nio for no reason or just because they were to afraid of taking a risk.

Anyway never listen to other people, do your own research and analysis."
"Some investing tips for individual stocks are to go to google and type in the company name & investor relations. Ex: Nio investor relations.

From the company website they have quarterly and annual earnings to look at to see their revenue, operating expenses, cash flow, etc. Compare the recent reports to past reports to see if the company is moving in the right direction or not.

There is also a conference call on that website so you can listen to the CEO and CFO discuss the numbers and future outlook.

Did Nio deserve to be a $1 stock last year? Yes it absolutely did because one quarter it lost almost half a billion dollars, burned alot of their cash reserves, AND CANCELLED the conference call that day. Future outlook was uncertain because it was unknown whether Nio can secure any funding to keep operating and there were fears of being delisted from the Nasdaq.

However, quarter after quarter it has been beating expectations, decreased their cash burn, and secured funding to keep operating for a long time. 

Yes Nio is still operating on a loss but did you know it took tesla 16 years to become profitable? Many companies are operating at a loss right now such as Uber, retail, airline industry, etc. The important thing is to see if their numbers are improving and if the company is growing to a path of profitability years ahead. 

I said in the comments last week that I wasn't worried about Nio stock price going down because Tesla releases earnings this week and the ev market goes up on Tesla outlook. What you should be doing is to do your company research on one quarter, invest if you see any upside, then wait till the next quarter and listen to conference call to see if you keep holding or dump. 

Right now I think Nio is undervalued and should be at least the price of the scam company Nikola.

But it's just my opinion. Don't listen to it so you can do your own objective research."
"At this point i only look at my portfolio when i wanna buy more. Everything i have is for 10-20 years down the road. 

No point in worrying about dips and panick selling.

When nio hits 100 i pay off my mortgage. Thats the only time ill sell."
"It happens, buy back in... for long term! It will pay back"
"make your own judgement and stick to it. people talk a lot and have different interests, including sell side analysts... short term trading is pure gambling, particularly in an growth company. if you believe in the company, get back in again and stay there for a few years - and meanwhile dont read all BS people talk"
"You were Jewed by Goldman. At least you were taken down by the best in the biz, that means something."
"Are you guys not concerned about ""cold war"" between China and US? There is a good chance Tik-Tok will be banned and if conditions escalate, wouldn't NIO also drop, especially the American depository shares?"
"That feels bad man. for real. I was in the red by $80 when it dipped but I stuck to my guns because I truly believe in NIO long term. Now that paid off because i did my own DD and I am back in the green by quite a bit. 

Volatility for a company such as NIO is inevitable. Doesn't mean it's bad or anything. If it drops for a certain period of time, people made short-term plays and taking profits. Dips give you opportunity to buy more shares. When it climbed back near to my average cost, I was able to buy more shares without increasing my average cost per share. Dont give up man. You can still make plays with NIO long term and short term. It's just that good of an opportunity. Just be smart about it. Reddit users and the stock market in general does not care how much money you lose, so you have to be strategic in your approach. Just my two cents."
"New to investing, I take chump change profits from day traders wannabe lil guys like you"
Very true. And I didn't have a plan... Can you give advice of different investing plans? It's hard to know how to think about different stocks.
Fuck yes. True. Need to own it. Sorry.
"With the rollout of car 50,000 over the weekend, the new model being presented Friday, and July/Q3 earnings around the corner, we hopefully will be looking at $18 not $8."
"Yes. But how do we know. The competition between the car producers is very hard and it will be more and more companies fighting about the EV market. It feels like it can go either way from here. Feels Iike I have adapted a more critical view after I sold, but idk."
"One doesn't even sell to the US yet. If you're talking about potential delisting, it would be another 3 years before that would happen due to regulations (and that's IF they don't comply and submit their books accordingly)."
"If you want I'll do a voice question and answer session with you. I'm on discord, WhatsApp, Snapchat, zoom. Too much to type."
"Btw you're not the only one, I sold a few at 12.3 yesterday mid day thinking that the run up was exhausted. Wrong call.

Stonks go up and down all the time and I still think that the 8$ gap will be closed at some point but with the bubble and fake market that we are in right now , I think that it will need the second leg of the crash for it.

Which will come for sure as the market will have to catch up with reality at some point and it will fall harder than the previous controlled one."
"I think the future in NIO is not only car sales... it is NIO power and in decreasing anxiety about range/battery, if things work well for NIO, it will help other cars using their battery swap stations... also remember Tencent is also behind them, they must see some future as well.
 
üöÄ"
I‚Äôm confused. What‚Äôs ‚Äú8 dollar gap‚Äù.
"I was/am thinking the exact same thing. Thank you.

There is many gaps just below and also it felt like a bubble. But the upcoming catalyst weights probably more than GS and the analytics according to the market.."
"It closed at 7.91 on July 1st and got a low of 8.70 on July 2nd, that's what is considered a 79 cts gap or about 10% which is significant.

Then you look at the following days and it did the same even bigger. I let you do the maths."
"If you're long, it doesn't matter if you bought at 12 or 15$. 

If the share goes to 100$ in 2-3 years, it will be the same."

Summary: 

They are challenging Germany in its own game. Had the fastest lap N√ºrburgring in 2017.

In the end, this is China's gold gem...  Proving that Chinese engineer's are in equal footing with the Mercedes of the world.

Long live NIO and make me retire in 2 years...  May the money God bless us all..."
Im so excited about this.. man if this hits 100 im gonna flip.
"Tesla went up almost 10% today, which is insane.

The EV sector followed Tesla."
"I beg to ask, what would you need to retire?"
Nio was up before tesla ya doink
NKLA was down tho
$15 mil
"It also fell friday by 15%

The entire ev sector was up today because of tesla."
"NKLA shouldn't be considered (in the EV sector), it's a scam."
There was an event.
don't compare Nio to TSLA and NKLA. TSLA is way more advanced than Nio and has more brand power at the moment.
How much have you bought already? My god
What if the tail wags the dog? Tesla is only so high because Nio is proof of concept for Tesla.
"NIO was up today first, but that's just a bounce from the major drop on Friday. However, I do agree that Tesla did push NIO up from +10% to +15%, thanks to sector sympathy. If all goes well for Tesla during earnings announcement, I am sure it will hit 2k by Friday."
38k shares...  Lol...  At $3.86
"If tsla goes to 2k, expect EVs to blow up"
"That‚Äôs amazing. Great job. Fortunes favor the bold! What made you get in at that time, and what was your deciding factor ?"
"Roadmap already drawn for NIO.  Just a matter of time.

Do you invest?"
"Got it. So, sell my entire Tesla portfolio and dump into NIO. 

10-4"
Lol this affects US companies more than it affects Nio as Nio doesn't even sell any cars in the U.S.
And they are planning to expand to EU WAY before US
"True, but I don't mind seeing this post either. The more info the better imo"
"Love this, fuck Goldman Sachs"
All hail Li Bin
"Goldman Sachs bought like 50M shares on the dip they created.

Edit: sorry, it was 800k shares but still"
Lol. Perfect..
Papa Bin
"Could we confirm this source please?
This is like best news for the day"
Sorry for somewhat misleading you. I was going off of what a friend of mine said. After researching I couldn‚Äôt find their exact trades but they still have a shitload of shares. [Their stake is 1.2%](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=NIO&subView=institutional)
"I am sure NIO is more interested in EU expansion due to the favorable laws by the government.  South East Asia is probably the one of the last places they will try to capture ( bad infrastructure, low support from local government, bureaucratic red tapes,  low average purchasing power)."
"It‚Äôs too early to expect a SE Asia timeline. They are just starting to ramp up locally with a focus on expanding to EU and then the US, key market revenue drivers for growth. SE Asia is fragmented with lower purchasing power and a lot more red tape and less EV incentives. We are probably looking at more than a few years before this gets movement.

Edit: Don‚Äôt get me wrong .. I would love to buy a NIO if it were available in my country but I am located in Taiwan.. the political/governmental relationship between China and Taiwan is of a particular challenge when it comes to business."
"No way. Indonesia lacks the infrastructure for electric car charging. I'm from Indonesia. The best placed nation in SE Asia for electric car is Thailand I'd say.

Btw, Bluebird, the biggest taxi company in Indonesia purchased Tesla and BYD E6 for their taxi fleet. It's more of a PR stunt than anything else seeing that the driver has to return to only 2 charging stations. They only have 5 Teslas and 25 BYDs.

What you can expect is electric bike. I heard from my friend, they already started using electric bike/scooter (can't remember which one) for food delivery (I think it's Grab though, not Gojek).

[https://jakartaglobe.id/context/blue-bird-goes-electric-with-tesla-and-byd-cars/](https://jakartaglobe.id/context/blue-bird-goes-electric-with-tesla-and-byd-cars/)"
Not saying it would have to be consumer facing. What if Nio could be the official car of Gojek? That‚Äôd be huge.
I understand and personally I hate the CCP but I love Nio. Nio unites people. Probably like how people love Tesla but hate the US.

I wish I could buy one.
All in at @10
"I saw one in my community's parking lot, it is very eye catching from the outside. It also looks nice in the interior (window peek). I think i will prefer nio over Tesla if i am buying one EV"
Yeah ... iDioT
Not looking very promising with 2 cars dahhhhhuyaa
To the moon NIO and Morpheus

All in at 3.10 üôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèº
TBH there are over 50 Nio's parked outside. Should have taken a picture but heavy rain.
Social distancing
"How do you think Tesla started? NIO is fairly brand new company. Tesla started from the basement too, idiot"
Do you know if they have plans to sell them in the United States?
"As a Tesla owner and investor, I sure hope so. EV manufacturer competition aligns with Tesla's mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. Nio and Tesla have two different views about how pitstops on long trips should look (supercharging vs battery swaps). Barring a breakthrough in supercapacitor longevity, capacity, and manufacturing, I think the world of EVs in the future will have room for both."
"Nice to see the correction today. Sure that Sachs bloke loaded up nicely too!

Expecting a mini boom from Tesla earnings and steady rise to $20."
Lixiang will IPO in the US on July 31st.  [https://www.chinapev.com/ev-2/lixiang/lixiang-automotive-to-be-listed-in-u-s-nasdaq-on-july-31th/](https://www.chinapev.com/ev-2/lixiang/lixiang-automotive-to-be-listed-in-u-s-nasdaq-on-july-31th/)
I'm happy that i added more contracts and positions when Nio was at 11$
You thinks it‚Äôs safe for the $14 strike contract?
Was there some good news this morning?
Nice to see a bounce back. I was feeling the sell off was a little unfair- no bad news at all but the market swung like that!
" Thanks 

Goldman sachs for the dire warning to sell **NIO on** Friday.  We did completely opposite just like you."
"Amazing that we have these daily discs.
We could have a weekly thread as well."
"Pretty bummed that I missed an opt to make a couple hundred off a put I had. I missed my chance because of work üò´ Sucks working a day job, I can barely trade ü•∫. Btw I‚Äôm long term bullish anyway."
"Me too. Even with the Goldman Sachs downgraded, price seems to have settled nicely around the $12 mark (supports around $11.95). Now we just need July earnings and/or Tesla earnings and I think we'll hit a solid $14 off of that. My guess is $20 by end of August at the earliest. Either way I'm optimistic"
Turning out a gross profit too!
!Remindme 7/30/20
"Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't Lixiang a hybrid fuel/battery solution? I'm not familiar with the company, but what is their main value offering?"
Same. Felt risky but I set buy limits for $11 and picked up some nice discounts
I've got the same. Exp 7/31
50K manufactured on 18th Jul. Compare it with total delivery as of June :)
Youre seeing bulls buying the dip.

"Yes, I believe they make a range extended EV. They are a new  Chinese startup competing in the luxury vehicle space. Definitely a close competitor for NIO, albeit smaller with less ambition, but also already profitable I believe."
I bought some more üñê
"Think he means July deliveries, which are due in the first couple days of August"
"I'm not opposed to waiting a bit longer. On the one hand, the quicker bump would be nice! On the other, I expect the next earning report to be better than the previous, and the longer it stays at a lower level, the more I can buy in before the gains hit.

Either way, here's to hoping more good things to come for all! Cheers!"
"Ahh I see, thanks for the clarification!"
"Bought mine Friday before close, happy I did"
That is in fact what I meant lol
Oopsies haha
"Yeah. I pretty much ignore the short term speculators here who is discussing about the price fluctuations daily, because I believe nio to be a very very long term hold. To more good news! :)"
Lmao aint u the weak hands guy who dumped on 11ü§£
"sold 4 BYD, a Buffett play"
Brought a few more shares about half an hour into trading. Very pleased with the growth
Went all in on 8 still holding
"Yep. Bought at opening. Also bought at 13 a few weeks ago, and at 4 a few months ago. Only have 1k$ in though."
"I sold at $12 last week and got back in at $10.70, earth looks amazing from here"
Loaded up more shares on the dip. Continuing to hold~ enjoy the ride everyone
Bought in at $3.00. Holding forever!
Yeah he stated on Thursday that he was dumping on Fridayüêµü§£
I sold at 13 you baboon
Great man.
"Word your in cheap, wouldn't sell for a while"
"Man doesn't matter how much you have in it bro, it's all about the % , hopefully more gains to come. Good luck."
"Loool, around the same here. Are you me?"
"Bought at 12, did the same today so clearly it worked. Made more money this way LMFAO."
"I know, but it's all the potentially missed gains! I'm never going all in right at the beginning. Always go bit by bit and miss lots 9f gains. Same with tesla. Went in with 5 shares a 250, I now have 50 but with 700 average... It's frustrating ahzh"
Keep at it autist!
"It's frustrating but allows you to minimize risk as well! Don't worry man, your average cost is still great."

Good
Guanxi proof or it didn't happen
"Tencent owns 16/17% of Nio, for example"
"This account is kinda suspicious. One month old, and all 3 of your posts are suggesting some sort of Nio-police force deal"
"Chinese Gov helping to bump up sales numbers, I would rather see organic growth."
"The photo shows ÂÖ¨ÂÆâ, which directly translates to ‚Äòpublic safety‚Äô which in essence refers to the police, on the bonnet with ‚Äòpolice‚Äô also written below the chinese characters

I understand that there was another photo posted of NIO cars with ÂÖ¨ÂÆâ written at the side of the car. Was a little skeptical about the first post with that photo but this photo showing a police vehicle having a battery swap done in the wild is promising. If there‚Äôs no official deal with the police yet, it at least means that the police are testing the viability of their vehicles"
Well the license plate at least looks right.
ok whatever look at nio right now dumb ass bitch
"Also posting accusations of NIO being involved in creating military drones. Very suspicious. Edit: he/she deleted the military drone post.

Edit 2: I stand corrected. I just saw a post that a new joint partnership between GAC and NIO has formed. Something about drones, but article is in Mandarin. It was on Twitter, posted by iron giant - a huge NIO bull.


The GAC-NIO just a strategic cooperation agreement with Hanyue (national level) aviation flight"" and will start strategic cooperation, covering three major aspects including brand promotion, competition cooperation, and drone technology education

okay
This embeds the fact that the government is behind NIO

"Illegal : having a stock, hyping the stock up with news, and selling off.

Legal : shorting a stock, trash talk and downgrade stock, and covering the short.

(Also) Legal: trash talking and downgrade stock, just to buy it at a lower price, and naturally pumping the stock price back up as you're an institutional buyer buying millions of units."
"He makes a good point on the average price recommendation for the stock, it seems absurd to downgrade it when the average price point is 38$."
Ridiculous. I'm still a long term believer in nio.
Before Goldman was listed on the NYSE I used to trust their research. Now while I still read their research it's not the only opinion I consider when making an investment especially in regard to Nio.
I thing they only did it to manipulate the price down

I do not know.
That state financing wasn‚Äôt totally for free
What? What are half of these responses I‚Äôm getting? Is this what the NIO share holders are like...
"Hold forever! I am in loss with NIO atm but I don‚Äôt see any reason why it won‚Äôt go back up. I won‚Äôt mind if it drops down to around $9, that‚Äôs when I plan to add some more."
"So your average price is 8 and you are panicking? Sigh, can't believe you were one of those that bought at $2."
hope you held on tight..

Well I‚Äôm into my Supercars and motor racing so I‚Äôve always like NIO and I think the battery swap is a big benefit. I only had 500 on though so considering I went balls deep at $15 I was panicking üòÇ what did you buy in @
Why is it going down
"As in when it hits 9$ then go all in? The house, car, wife, everything?"
He/she means buy  Jul 24 $9 put options
White is a highly popular car color in China. I would read much into it.
"I don't know with NIO, but white colour is most of the time cheapest because it is the 'base' colour. People who dont care about car colour buy the cheapest option. Also white colour helps a lot in hot climate zones. Eastern China regions are quite hot in summer."
"‚ÄòWhite‚Äô is universally appealing from a marketing standpoint and accentuates a vehicles size. 

Worldwide ‚ÄòWhite‚Äô is the predominate color preference for new vehicles by a wide margin and in certain circumstances can even improve a cars resell value long term 

Don‚Äôt look into it too much, it‚Äôs entirely a marketing ploy."
"Very impressive I doubt any other brand has 500 million EV miles besides Tesla & Nissan. Nio truly is #2 in the industry.

Edit: Nissan probs has done this already."
"Does Nio collect all the info feedback from their vehicles?

Does Nio do over the air updates to its vehicles?

How involved is Nio in this process vs Mobileeye?"
Nissan very likely has it with the Leaf.
Nio has OTA
"I found this  **Nissan** just announced it has sold 400,000 **Nissan Leaf** EVs worldwide since the first **Leaf** whirred off a dealer lot in 2010 from March 2019. So lets say 500M divided by 400,000. 

Yeah that's about 1250 miles per Leaf. Yeah your totally right on that."
"What's matter isn't so much how many miles have been done with an EVs but how many have been done ""autonomously"" and/or collecting data for it.

Nissan has made 0 I would say, while NIO is likely collecting data but I'm not sure about it."

"where is the 50k information from? that would be insane, 5451 deliveries in July, we are only 2/3 into the month. hard to believe"
"So 50,000 - 46,082 = 3,918

Note that the report I saw said they only PRODUCED their 50,000th car, not delivered, but it is promising since it is only July 18th. Considering that number already exceeds the deliveries for June it seems like a good sign. FYI I got the 46,082 from a cleantechnica article earlier this month regarding the June delivery numbers. I'll attach links to both for those interested below:

50K Reporting CNTechPost: https://cntechpost.com/2020/07/18/nios-50000th-car-rolls-off-assembly-line-at-hefei-manufacturing-facility/

Cleantechnica: https://cleantechnica.com/2020/07/03/nio-reports-record-sales-in-june/"
[deleted]
"My estimate is 5530\~5630, which is another 48%\~50% growth from June!

Here is the math:

On July 18, NIO just celebrated their 50,000th car rolls off, which means there are 3,918 already (50,000-46,082(By 06/30/2020)=3,918)

In June, NIO has 3,740 delivered. In average the daily delivery# is 124.666 (3740/30=124.666..), In July, there are 13 days left. So using the most conservative approach, they can produce 1620 cars.

(124.666\*13=1620)

So the estimated delivery number is 5,538 (1620+3,918) minimal."
This is great news!
I c what u did there... quoting  hannity psycho
Do they have plans to deliver in the US?
So July delivery probably begins with a 4
"Production numbers are based on one 10 hours shift.

Is there any reason why JAC could not instal two 10 hours shifts & double production. Also what are the latest estimates when Tesla Model Y factory starts production in Shanghai."
"5,451 for those who don't want to do math..because its racist"
Ready\*\* to deliver
"great, thanks for sources/clarifications. Very promising indeed! Do we already have production capacities for the ec6?"
"the 46082 seems to be the DELIVERED cars, not produced. As far as we know they may have produced 49,999 as of june 30th 2020.

&#x200B;

EDIT: your 3,918 is the BEST case scenario."

Totally agree as a Chinese investor here.
100% agree with this
"I haven't seen anything in regards to the numbers for EC6 preorders specifically, and I have a hunch we'll have to wait until the official Q2 report for that news. In regards to the production capacity NIO is working with JAC to increase the amount of cars they can produce on a monthly basis. Back in May it was reported by technode that they could only produce 4k cars a month max. The information I was given was that the ES8, ES6, and EC6 all use the same frame and can be built on the same production line, but I haven't tried to verify that piece of information. It also said in that technode article they planned on increasing their number to 5K per month by September. Considering they've already produced almost 4K cars with 1/3rd of the month remaining is a good sign that their production capability is scaling up. I wouldn't be surprised if they were able to increase the number to more than 5K a month by September since they're almost at that pace already. Sidenote comment, that production line bottleneck is the reason I was told why the ET7 the sedan that is the next anticipated model was postponed last year (since it's a different frame, and thus a different line would need to be assembled). 

Note: I am not an expert in car assembly lines, so if i butchered that explanation or have anything wrong about the process please forgive me.

"yeah you're right that it's a best case scenario, but I don't think it's impossible. I am just assessing they were low on excess/on-hand inventory due to the pandemic and the supply chain issues that came with it. Also, Nio reported that they had order backlogs since February when they posted their March delivery numbers. So since delivery numbers have been above 3k for April, May, and June with a reported production bottleneck of 4k per month, I don't think they had a bunch of ES6/ES8's lying around. Once again, this is mostly an assessment/opinion.

They only build the vehicles as the are ordered. All are custom built. So yes. Delivered.
How is 5451 calculated?
What did the comment say? It was deleted...
"great information, thank you"
built and delivered is different.
They said NIO should do a better job of press releases etc for these type of events for USA investors. That being said they posted on twitter later!
So they‚Äôre going to custom build it for a customer who paid for it and not deliver it lol. Okay.
Thanks!
"it takes time to deliver, have you ever heard of the line ""Inventory"" in financial statements. My point is, the important metric is the # of cars built, and in this case, we do not know. The BEST case scenario is about 4000 cars in 18 days, which I consider actually pretty good. I'm expecting above 10,000 deliveries (12-13k built) in Q2 2020 and we're going to the moon.

Edit: for example, Nio had about $136 million in Inventory at the end of Q1 2020, those are cars built but NOT delivered. There's a whole logistic procedure going on to simply deliver a car. It's not done overnight."
Great. We have an insider here that knows everything! You
"just read their statements, its  available to the public"
End of the year/early 2021
It got delayed and will be on next gen power train. Nio day this year
"I am more interested in the actual price of EC6, they're supposed to announced it this month and we have 10 days left for July."
EC6 pricing will be announced during chendu motor show starting July 24th.
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/dapplife.com/nio-could-launch-first-ev-sedan-et7-by-end-of-2020-to-rival-tesla-model-s-7829/amp

Didn‚Äôt see any new information about ET7 launch!"
"Read the title of your article...

Also you guys realize there‚Äôs another car releasing before this right? One step at a time"
"Nio day is in December, and if it's anything like the ES6 and EC6 timelines they'll announce the ET7, with deliveries likely starting summer 2021.

Timelines:

NIO day 2018: ES6 officially announced.

June 2019: First ES6 deliveries. 

NIO day 2019: EC6 officially announced.

September 2020: First EC6 deliveries.

NIO day 2020: ET7 announcement (speculative)"
"Thanks to these guys for sharing this cute video of Nomi.  Each and every day I'm feeling more amazed with NIO.

Disclaimer : I'm super long NIO, look at my previous posts and you know that I've been a super long believer of NIO.

Also I started a big position in SHLL last month.

Both are fantastic for future of EV."
"Guys please like their video and subscribe to their YouTube channel to encourage them.

I'm personally rooting for them to come up with a video for EC6 and the super car as well !!!!!!!"
Nomi is so cute
"it's cute and all, but if they ever want to branch out to european market they need to cut that kawaii shit out. 

europeans want serious cars"
It comes out quarterly
Then why are people claiming GS just bought NIO shares this past week after their own analyst downgraded the stock?
"if you really want evidence then wait for the next SEC release, but by then it‚Äôll be too late to buy in on the dip. OR check the historical for previous occurrences of this happening .. plenty of examples."
Because they can‚Äôt accept the fact that GS downgraded NIO and that they‚Äôre losing money because of it. They try to find anything which convince them to hold which is an awful idea.
You're making my point.  We need evidence before anyone can claim GS bought or did not buy recent shares. I seek truth my friend.
So ... filing is out they upped their stake with 14% they now have 100.00.000 mill in equity with Nio .....
"This is what makes me scared having position in NIO since now it has got retail money involved. In my eyes NIO is a great company with likely bright future ahead and I‚Äôve been invested in it since IPO and got my average price down to 6$. Now I‚Äôve been slowly selling into this heat and I just got rid of my last shares last week. Right now my thesis is that since I believe NIO share price can go even higher in the future, but NIO price can still linger here for next few years because of this recent retail hype. Because of this I‚Äôm using this money somewhere else and waiting for the public to ‚Äúgive up‚Äù on NIO, before I get involved in it again.

When everyone agrees that the price is gonna go higher then it‚Äôs likely not gonna happen or at least not than soon aka they become bagholders."
"This guy is super good, very impartial, and amongst other things he has videos where he interviewed the ex-co-founder of Nio, test drove some Nio models, tried out the battery swap station etc etc. Seems to know a lot about China as a market and consumer base. Highly recommend this guy for keeping up to date but also for some passive DD"
He seems to be as neutral as possible in his assessment of Nio! I like this Chanel!
I too like designer bags
"Unless they have some unique IP, you probably don‚Äôt want to strap yourself with a Chinese battery supplier‚Äôs penny stock."
Sooooo?
You only care about stock soooo ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Lol
"These are the quality, informative posts this sub should have more of. Not ‚ÄúI bought and sold today! Made a profit of $300 and I‚Äôm happy!‚Äù"
"Ya, I realized the same thing when Nio released about Tencent's ownership a couple of days ago and all 4 signatures are Ma. Though I wouldn't tie that to CCP. Tencent is a huge company with a good record of investments. Not uncommon for bosses of companies of this scale in China to have some political positions. But what is clear is that China is trying to catch up in the car game now that we see EVs are the future and China at this point is giving strong support to battery swapping."
Will the govt ties cause NIO to be delisted?
Mother of God. I missed the chance to invest in Tencent few years ago and look at its price now. The wisdom of DCA and index investing....
"On a side note: Lixiang Auto is owned by the same two men who founded NIO and they're about to go public. They make a hybrid electric vehicle. Just more info to digest. 

 [https://m.futurecar.com/3708/Chinese-Automaker-Lixiang-Automotive-Has-Filed-for-a-Confidential-U-S--IPO-Sources-Say](https://m.futurecar.com/3708/Chinese-Automaker-Lixiang-Automotive-Has-Filed-for-a-Confidential-U-S--IPO-Sources-Say)"
"Yeah, this is great - I learned something.  Ya know that NIO should have a big chunk of the Chinese market but now I know why."
lol
"We're past the point that China is catching up. They are already #1 in annual sales for EV, and they've only captured 5% of their market lol"
I doubt it. Trump is busy preparing for election campaign and playing influencer by promoting canned beans.
This is false.. William Li Bin did not found Li auto lmao
"Oh I would have never expected that. Sounds really interesting, more choices for the customer at different price points to accelerate the adoption of EVs in China."
I mean China is trying to catch in terms of car technology which has been China's weak point in terms of ICE cars.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüíØ
Lixiang Auto is backed by Meituan and Bytedance and currently the 2nd best selling local startup car manufacturer in China. I can't find any info about Li Bin investing in Lixiang Auto.
"Simple, those people don't really understand Nio. They are just gambling or FOMO."
"Because nobody ever went broke taking profits.  Can you say with 100% certainty that NIO will continue to go up and hit 50-60 by next year?  Which magic hat did you pull out these numbers from?

Everyone has a different style of trading and investing. Focus on you doing you."
it's hard for people to hold when they think it will go down to $8... they rather sell and buy back at the lower price.
"when a stock goes up by 100% in 3 weeks, it's always better to secure profits. I mean tesla was between $150-$350  from 2014-2019 ( went up and down like crazy), so anything is possible with a volatile stock like this.

I don't think people want to keep a stock, especially if it would take at least 2 years for the company to be profitable. on top of all that, US COVID -19 cases an increasing and there is a fear of downturn soon, which is only fair to assume when 53 million Americans are out of a job.

when the US markets tank a bit. so is TSLA and so is NIO, it is just a ripple effect.

So people rather want to buy it back cheaper."
I usually leave some spare cash by the side so I buy more when one of my purchased stocks go south. I see this drop as an absolute win
"Ey I would hold at least till 2023. 2022 is gonna be a big year, roll out of ribotaxi in china in partnership with MobilEye"
Every small cap stock does this let‚Äôs be honest. If you wanted to hold long why not buy in after it was being pumped. The trick for people who actually think the company will do well is to wait for volume to go to stable levels and then buy and hold lmao.
"The price of a stock is always fluctuating because of speculators, even more so these past 1 month. The hot stock of the week is vaccine stocks and they want in on that. These are gains chaser, not investors that took the time to read fundamentals. They don't even give a hoot about NIO. From research, these promiscuous ""investors"" don't make more than the long term investors."
"i sold some covered calls for 15 strike 7/31, but I'm scared i might lose my shares this week lol"
I sold some trying to take advantage of the GS price dip (like a greedy cunt). And it really backfired
"They don't call them ""diamond hands"" for nothing."
"They dont understand investing period.

Its like those memes that say ""if you bough netflix stock 10 years ago it would be worth millions""

What the meme doesnt tell u is that u would have had to HOLD netflix thru VARIOUS dips."
What you are describing is people that don‚Äôt know how to use put options. If they really believed there was a good chance for a fall to $8 they could buy some cheap short term puts while maintaining their longterm Nio position. They could also use the profits from those puts to buy even more Nio when it dips.
"These aren't investors, they are momentum traders. One week they're in EV, the next week they are in vaccines."
"How far out should one buy and when should they sell? The time factor fucks up options , maybe I‚Äôm just not buying at the right price and right distance time wise"
this is a great way to hedge... i would say maybe only 10% of investors know about options
"Buy puts around a lower support level. Sell if it goes in the money. Buy short term, two weeks or a month out. Those are cheaper and allow you to keep more money invested."
"So if the price of a stock is at $12 per share, but I think it‚Äôll drop down towards the lower support of $10, I should buy a $10 out contract with two weeks to a month out?"
Yea. Buy something that is cheap enough you will gladly be wrong but also one that pays enough to be worthwhile. That is the balance.
100% agreed man
"I'd dump those puts ASAP, just my 2 cents of course."
Because your puts are still out of the money so they technically still have a value of 0 until the share price falls below 10
"These puts have already priced in the move, because of the run up volatility. That‚Äôs why you want to dump your options into big moves and buy when share price has dumped or consolidated for some time. If NIO should bounce back up to 15 you‚Äôre gonna get absolutely hammered on these puts so be careful. Also if you‚Äôre looking for bigger profits then you have to take closer expiration. And there‚Äôs one more great strategy more which is writing these juiced up calls and collecting premium depending how big your account is."
is that all there is to it?
"Yeah, look at the option prices relative to the share price, puts that are in the money progressively are worth more on value % wise vs out of the money"
"The fact your friends don‚Äôt know the brand is called runway. This is the first chance China has to establish an entry-level luxury brand. It cannot be allowed to fail. This is the marriage of militarised state manufacturing on one hand and big tech software/battery development on the other. 

Also, and this counts for something, the only country with a full retard cultural revolution going on is the USA.  China is an upwardly mobile society and the US is now a downwardly mobile one. The US society has absolutely zero discipline, in fact it has an unemployable underclass, a fifth column that stabs it in the back during times of trouble."
Point 5 on your bearish case is cracking me up. China's a step away from being the number 1 economy in the world.
This dude is hilarious. Watch him delete this post and then his account and come back into the subreddit with a new account as a NIO bull üòÇ
"I appreciate your willingness to have this discussion but there seems to be some holes in your argument and I would like to clarify:

1. Your argument might be valid if you only invested in value stocks but clearly this is a growth stock. I'm sure you've taken a look at Tesla's finances 4-6 years into their IPO
2. This is true but this is also based on the premise that Tesla's valuation is 'nonsensical'. You didn't back that up at all and this is arguing that the EV market is just a bubble, which is a completely different argument itself and not specific for NIO. If you really want to short companies based on PS ratios, there are many better companies to short, i.e. NKLA lol
3. Yup.
4. Sure, it's possible. Is it likely to happen in the near future? No, I think their gov/bank/tencent funding will last them for at least the next 2 years and by that point, their sales will have grown tremendously based on their projections
5. This is false. China's GDP grew by 3.2% last quarter, their economy is actually booming. People in China are at the point where they rarely even wear masks anymore because many big cities are no longer reporting cases. (source: friends living in China, and the internet). If more cases come up, China is very good at handling it
6. ""Fixated"" is misleading. They market themselves as a lifestyle brand. They mainly sell cars and offer some other products and services. Your opinion that they should not sell other products is just that, an opinion. This is ironic that you said not to speak opinions yet you just stated one. To counter your opinion, I think the NIO houses are really cool and offer a competitive edge/sales tactic for people who want more exclusivity.
7. Similarly, this is anecdotal. You think the brand is weak because your 2 friends living in china have never heard of it? Who are your friends? Are they Chinese? Are they looking to buy electric cars? I've heard from people in China that their brand is popping off this year. Maybe try asking your friends again in 6 months

I think you are not telling us anything we don't already know (at least the longs)."
"Bear Case:

1. They will sell more cars, lower costs, and become profitable (I expect in a few more quarters, 2 or 3).
2. They will grow, so I don't see the stock price going down. Valuation isn't crazy IMO. Current market cap 13B.
3. Who knows, but I am in long term and Nio is showing good growth.
4. They are focusing on their cars and building the brand at the same time. Nio builds good cars and it is the flagship Chinese EV brand, these are the results of all the cash burnt.
5. I think their brand is strong and getting stronger.
6. short term? I think they will have good news early August and the stock price will go up. And I don't see Nio's growth slowing down."
I think the loss is in Chinese currency instead of U.S currency.
"The best answer to all of this is to look at what the experts are doing.

Goldman Sachs downgraded them on Friday saying the stock was worth $7, which caused the stock to drop rapidly. Then on the very same day Goldman Sachs went out and purchased nearly 750,000 shares at a price range somewhere between $11-$13.

Unless someone can make sense of that, it makes a great case on its own for GS not ‚Äúbuying‚Äù what they are ‚Äúselling‚Äù. Either that or they hate their own Analyst."
"As someone new to all of this I appreciate you taking the time to start this discussion. I‚Äôm only using a small amount of funds I can afford to lose, but the potential future of this company is very exciting to me."
"Overall, an excellent pros and cons list for being a NIO bear.  I agree with most of your points here.

However, I will have to disagree with Point 5 and 6 on Cons.

While everyone's economic growth  has gone negative compared to 1 year ago, China is up 3% right now. I am confident that China will outperform all other economies in this upcoming global recession. Even if China decides to only produce for its local market, that's enough to keep growth positive (maybe 0-1% growth?). I can't say the same for countries that are dependent on cheap Asian goods though. Quoting from WSJ, "" With the second-quarter growth, China is looking more like a bright spot in a world ravaged by the pandemic. The International Monetary Fund expects China‚Äôs economy will grow 1.2% for the full year, which would make it the only large economy to report positive data in 2020"".

Number 6  of your cons seems like a personal opinion. I will give you some facts from the latest ADS offering statement. 

""We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering mainly to fund our cash investments in NIO China, as well as other working capital needs. We expect NIO China will use the cash investments as follows: (i) approximately 30% on research and development of products, services and technology; (ii) approximately 15% on development of our manufacturing facilities and roll-out of our supply chain; (iii) approximately 40% on operation and development of our sales and service network; and (iv) the remaining for general business support purpose""."

great post! eying an $8 bottom as well
"I agree man. This is a company that is government backed and as you say society that is trending positively, I'm in the States at the moment, the split between normalised cognitive function and the rest who are stroking about everything doesn't bode well for a democratic society that like pointing fingers andd blaming each other for everything.

Why?  Do you have any facts to back this up?  Or just your belief in the story?
"Just to clarify, I'm not calling $8 the bottom, just seeing a high potential for a bounce there.  $6 is my final target, if it goes any lower than that, it'll just have to drop without me."
It isn‚Äôt entirely conjecture if people are basing their points on recent numbers
"Hypocritical, considering you called Tesla‚Äôs valuation ‚Äúnonsensical‚Äù and didn‚Äôt support that at all"
At the end of the day it‚Äôs all speculations and is based on how much you‚Äôre willing to gamble. TSLA was in a similar bubble not long ago and now look at them..

I bought more!

On July 24, 
1. Nio will start to received the order for model EC6, the price is under 300000 RMB= 43000 dollars.
2.they will start the BAAS system, that means that when you purchase NIO car, you can choose to buy the battery or rent the battery if you rent the battery, the price will lower down 15000 dollars, more people can afford to buy NIO, also, when people resell Nio's car, you do not need to consider the loss of the battery life, because you only rent the battery.
3. my friend from NIO'a car factory told they are super busy, they expand one more line to produce NIO's car, think about the delivery number for July. the car they produce now is the order received two months ago, it is super busy.
4. Tencent just increases the share last week, they know what is going to happen in July 24."

 [https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/fei-fang](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/fei-fang) 

If you're trying to read the momentum and profit off the movements, do your thing - there are definitely going to be some shakey retail investors evaluating the short-run opportunity cost of holding this stock. If you believe you can time the market for this stock all power to you.

This is a company that is positioned to capture a decent share in a very large market, showcasing growth in sales and adequate financing. The brand itself is starting to carve out somewhat of a niche in China. Every price movement without tangible news is just noise."
Love to see how robinhooders are panicking. Average person dont make money on stock market cause they follow the herd. Goldman Sachs always tries manipulate. The same was with AMD with their price targets of 6 or 7$ Look how it turned out. If you can't sleep being down 50%. NIO stock is not for you.

""Yeh and Goldman also had downgraded Apple to sell on 4/17. It surged from $282 to $382. Goldman go figure."""
"One random analyst named Feng pumps out an article setting target of 7 and the stock crashes. How retarded are people? That analyst isn't the entire Goldman speaking, its just one analyst playing a guessing game with no logical explanation. Doubled down and sold calls."
"Goldman Sachs did the same two weeks ago, it downgraded Nio from bullish to neutral (same Feng dude). Guess what, over the week-end it went from 7 to 15. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a stellar jump after this Goldman Sachs circus is over"
I remember when I had Ubiquity that Cramer was trash-talking the company. Look at it's price now. `NASDAQ:UI`
"I sold it at $15 when it failed to hold it 3 times

14.92 is the capped call provision on convertible bonds. There are hundreds of millions worth of sellers above 15"
Think this analyst gave Nio a downgrade when it was trading around 7 dollars a while ago. Guess what is happing now...
Oh boy...
"so where does it bottom out today after the selloff?

i've got a buy order at 10.75 but my fomo is strong

bought at 11.65 lol, seemed to bottom at 11.50 and was chasing it for a bit"
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NIO/community/
When is $NIO going to release their numbers on how many cars they sold in July? And where can I find them?
"Buy now, before the discount ends. Stock will rise to 12 again tomorrow for sure. People overreact from sudden drops like this."
Goldman is a zombie company that only exists because of bailout. The emperor has no clothes.
Which mean real price target is 14$.
"Remember Goldman is the same company that said Lehman's is a buy right before they went bust!

&#x200B;

Goldman downgrades to a sell, probably buying calls / selling puts and also buying shares themselves.  I don't trust their integrity"
"Goldman downgraded Tesla a month ago right before the stock price went from $1K to $1,500K per share.  You don‚Äôt know the power of the Robinhooders (insert Darth Vader GIF) so fk that noise and long NIO"
Yeah me too think about selling
This isn‚Äôt Tesla fellas. Quit thinking everything EV stock is going to be the next one
Im nervous.
Garbage stock
"Sorry, I'm following NIO closely, but what's happening 7/24?."
What's happening on July 24th?
The fact is this 1 is just pure rumor. 2 might be true. EC6 pricing on July 24th sounds realistic but I don't think we know the actual pricing today.
goldman did? where can i find that data...
"exactly, its going to drill then Moon again."
Same analyst put a price target of $20 on a stock 6 years ago that now trades at around $1.76.
Ima quadruple down on this shit
"Yeah I thought the same thing. What price do you think the bottom will be? I think it could theoretically go as low as $8.50, but I don‚Äôt want to get undercut and miss out"
Reverse Pump and Dump. I guess it's not illegal to do that.
"Just curious, are you going to sell and wait for it to dip more before buying more? I bought at $13.05 and idk if I should hold and keep buying when it dips or sell now and see if it goes to $7. I'm planning on holding long term"
"Whats this guys address, I just wanna talk"
It's crazy to have one GS analyst's opinion wiped off NIO's market cap by 2 BILLION in less than 24 hrs. His mediocre track records clearly shows that this guy is not worth listening to.
you are new to the markets aren't you?
[deleted]
Garbage stock that increased 300+%. Cry more
"Garbage analyst's, crazy how one analyst can crash a stock. It angers me so much and I wanna beat whoever rated it to a pulp"
"Nio will reveal EC6 pricing in Chengdu Auto show starting July24th,"
Just google Goldman upgrades NIO. Then check the date stamp on the article
Doesn‚Äôt Goldman have a price target of $240 for TSLA? üòÇ
I‚Äôm looking for $10 a share. When it hits 10.. it‚Äôll be for maybe a few hours. I‚Äôm gonna sell some positions and just go heavy on Nio. Something I‚Äôve never done.. this heavy in one position. But unless China is just bullshitting everything we read.. im ready to sit and wait for a few years.
"I‚Äôm not buying anymore, but I think there‚Äôs a strong possibility it will dip to low 10 and will recover and I will sell at 20."
"dont worry, its just short-term. and its not one person, it GS behind it. ...AND its biased to their own interests as an investment firm (he will get clear instructions on how to rate). so dont worry"
Im gonna hold. I pannick sold draft kings at 38.  Wish i held.
"I'm considering selling my entire position if it hits break even, then re buying in."
What‚Äôs a good mark for rebuy?
Seems to be like that... everytime I touch the stock market it runs away from me
"No need to, just load up some more right now or wait a few hours/days if you believe in the stock / company. The stock was the same price 10 days ago."
Tesla will also be releasing earnings on July 22nd.
"Yep. Keep in mind this is not ""Goldman Sachs"". It's quite literally one person that works for Goldman Sachs covering stocks. You can find their profile here:

[https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/fei-fang](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/fei-fang)"
I don‚Äôt blame you man
It might fill gaps before moving up. Price action for now does not look good
"I think there's good reason to expect good earnings reports form Tesla and Nio. Nio's might be less than their June sales though, so I hope that doesn't spooky people."
Just buy some today already. It's common knowledge that extreme drops like today will be followed by a slight bounce back the next day. I am expecting it to go back up to 12 again tomorrow.
It seems to have stayed at 11 for now
"10-11 is good support level it seems, I bought more today! It will bounce back"
Earnings will be in September for NIO but it will likely surf the Tesla tsunami of next week.
It's Friday....
You predicted the future pretty much perfectly
"Oops, I meant Monday."
It's not really a correction anymore if it just goes completely back to prior levels.
The gap theory from technical analysis doesn't always hold. Just like how a cloudy sky doesn't guarantee rain.
yes but there is a 91% probability that it will
And there's a 9% probability that it went back up to nearly $13 dollars today.
"Been out since upper 14's waiting for dust to settle, technically speaking.  Haven't seen the dust settle yet.

When I see clear cues of share price increase, I'll look at NIO again.  Stock seems to have a pretty tangential relationship to companies' business in many/most cases.  Which is to say, I'm sure NIO will be fine, not sure about their stock (or the ADR delist threat)....."
"I‚Äôm holding mine for now. If the new reports next week don‚Äôt help it rise, I‚Äôm selling and cutting my losses. Fortunately, I didn‚Äôt put too much in."
I feel extremely sad at how this is going. Bought in at 14
"I agree man, the delist I feel is unlikely as that would really kick up a notch in the trade war, but you never know with the current administration."
Yeah when the dust settles you‚Äôll be buying back at the same price you sold out.
Doubtful.
Lol
"It's a good point! Stocks need good news, and this good news needs to be spread to the masses to keep momentum up. One concern I have with NIO is how does it get widespread attention? It's a Chinese company that doesn't operate over seas (yet)."
I'm sure that the Orange Goblin's opinion on China can't affect the stock market too long?
Take your medication
"Yea , cant wait till Biden is in and the whole market tanks when they reverse all the great things trump has done for big businesses.  I‚Äôll be sure to take my profits before that idiot gets in and buy when we see record lows on everything"
"Well I‚Äôm up 10k, so ya I need my medication to stay positive. But I understand that you keep messing up and bag holding and what not. The stock market isn‚Äôt for everyone."
So tell me all the great things he's done for big business and how the stock market wasn't good during Obama. I'll wait. You sound like your drowning in orange kool aid.
Take another one
Ok :)
"All about [NIO](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=nio) 

$48 end of year.

NIO will be one of the winners in this race of mobile electrification. I believe their biggest competitive advantage is the battery as a service or BAAS.  The living dynamic in China are multi-residential buildings.  This answers the need of the market.  The wait time is as fast as pumping gasoline.

Sales keeps skyrocketing, so thus BAAS. Very similar to the iPhone - Apps ecosystem.  You cannot live without the other.

If NIO allows other vehicles to use their BAAS technology.  Then this stock will make me a multi-millionaire."
[removed]
. This company to me has got extreme potential to take off. They have backing by the Chinese government/Tencent/ cars in production vs Nikola which if I'm correct has nothing and there stock is high. Plus a huge amount of popularity and known now to be Tesla's competitor. They have battery changing patent. Ect I could go on. Just wait and hold.
"Damn I panic sold for a loss yesterday, now I bought back in.

#RobinhoodLife"
The huge downgrade by Goldman sachs is why it's taking a hit. My bet is itll consolidate around 10. Time to buy back in boys.
What is happening premarket? Was up 4% now down almost 5%??
Why is NIO taking such a hit today?
"I'll sell when the CEO dies. If you take a look at his interviews, you can definitely tell his character. Dude cares and very outspoken. Until then, I'm holding my large investment."
This isn't pleasant but I am not panicking yet. Nio is a seemingly good company backed by groups who know what they are doing.
Nio is so criminally undervalued is crazy
After seeing GS add to their position after the slander... easy calls for this week
"US government  won't allow NIO to grow. Look what happened to TIKTOK. NIO has tremendous potential and US govt will do everything it can to stop the growth, its sad really."
Moves for Monday?
" 

Just have a question as I am not understanding why my the profit seems to be similar for short selling vs buying put options.

I bought 15 Nov 20th 2020 $10 NIO Puts on July 13th for roughly $2.25 each when the price of NIO was roughly \~ 15.50 at the time.

Today they are worth roughly $2.90 when the price of NIO is at $11.00.

My price = 15 x $2.25 x 100 = $3375, today 15 x $2.90 x 100 = 4350. I am making roughly $975 atm.

If I were to short $3375 worth of shares at $15.50, I would be shorting about 217 shares.

At today's price, my profit would be ($15.50 - $11) x 217 = $976.5.

I know option pricing factor in a lot of things but in this scenario, I don't seem to be profiting much more from leverage. Why is this the case?"
"If you are waiting for the stock to go up, you are going to have to wait until Tesla stock goes up. Nio follows Tesla. Wednesday is Tesla earnings down it may be stagnant until then and should moon. I would sell after such an event and buy back in after it settles."
Does anyone know what price a share baillie gifford and tencent is invested at ?
"Mad talk in my opinion (correct me if you think I'm incorrect) NIO took a risk a while back pumping capital into expanding production to reap the benefits of being able to produce cars at a larger scale. The face they have some for of government backing and given the scale of population there I think they are in a great position over the next 5 years, I'm confident in my stance on it but I'm open to people questioning the approach"
"If they liscense the battery exchange function, I might make my first 10,000 from NIO stock."
Yes. This battery swap is huge and in my opinion is the future of ev. Its everyone's fear of owning an ev. Running out of miles and being stuck atva charge station for 2 hrs. I've read that tesla would have to pay nio to use the battery swap but I'm not sure.
Murn
Also they have a partnership with mobileeye for self driving and robo taxi(they just stated a target of 2022 for roll out)
[deleted]
I did the same other day... I am buying back in... just be prepared for ups and downs... but definitely 20 dollars by end of year ü§û
I agree! I doubled down to decrease my buying average!
Downgraded to Sell from Neutral by Goldman Sachs
"Not a hit, normal correction"
Fei Fang the Goldman Sachs analyst.
I'm panicking a LITTLE bit but only because I have tied up more of my personal wealth than I should have. Just hope their August earnings are decent.
"It will grow in China and in Europe! Also they can‚Äôt find it too hard, china is allowing a big factory for Tesla in China as well"
Who cares about USA gov. Its a China company and China is world's biggest economy.
Just wait for Trump to fuck the US economy so hard by the end of his term that the US economy or government don‚Äôt even matter much anymore. Just basing this of the covid response.
"Closing down 20% today, I predict a big green candle gap open Monday, people buying the new dip.

"Guys I have nio stock but be real. Tesla continues to develop longer lasting batteries. The longer the battery life, the less people need to charge at stations. The battery tech will only get better"
Mun
You simple hold when it is crashing. Have a long position and forget it.
inb4 you sell at bottom and it rockets up right after. you know how hard it is to time market perfectlly? just hold and come back in 2030.
"How is that ""normal corection""? Normal correction would be for Tesla to drop from 1.5K to 600 pts or for NIKOLA (without any production) to drop from 60 to 10, that's what I call normal correction. NIO is so undervalued, its crazy. It makes no sense."
"I see that, what was the basis for stating the low stock price?"
"My biggest concern is as of yesterday Nio's stock has derailed from following TSLA's every move.  I felt better knowing Tesla was dipping too, but now that no longer seems to be the case.

Think I'm getting out for a bit, it was a good run and I made a ton of money but my optimism for the short term is dipping faster than the stock price.  I'm an avid believer in MACD indicators and the 30 day trend is showing support tanking.  Indicates we are gonna continue dropping for the next two weeks.

[NIO 30 day MACD trend](https://i.imgur.com/Xsq9b3P.png)

Will probably buy back in  at $5.50 and start the ride again.  I expect a big bounce back up at $5.50-5.75 and a repeat of this month"
Yeah I always keep that in mind. Just in case China can also shut down Tesla's factory too.
Well The company is listed on a NYSE...
"What does ""10 covered calls"" mean?"
Where does it say 300b in five years?
Mindanda
"I sold at 14.90 due to hundreds of millions of dollars of convertible bonds having a $14.92 capped call provision. It's very clear on the chart there are many sellers coming in above $15. Price tested 3 times and sellers came through each time

So far $15 was not the bottom. it's looking like a temporary top.

I have a buy stop at $12"
"I'd love to see where NIO goes in 5 years, I think the next 12 months is crucial for them, correct me if I'm wrong"
Sounds like the Americans are propping up Tesla while trying to destroy the Chinese competition
"Dude thinks it's overpriced already and said ""no substantial changes to volume/profit expectations"" to support the $15+ high.  He also views the NIO China agreement with Hefei in a negative manner, only seeing it as a cash burn for the next 2 years."
good luck
"So is alibaba, and how much of their revenue comes from the US?"
So? Its a Chinese company. Based is China. Also everyone can invest in USA stock market.
"10 contracts, selling call options."
">Closing down 20% today, I predict a big green candle gap open Monday, people buying the new dip.My move sell about 10 covered calls, waiting on a green day to sell them.

means you own the shares already so when someone exercises a call, its already covered."
Change it to 10
Is he retarded? That literally saved the company lol
Remember that the richest man in China owns 1/3 of nio stocks!  Goldman Sachs words are too overrated to be honest.
and Nio promised positive margins this year.

The Chinese Economy GREW 3.2% in 3 months to June from a year earlier.
China economy prob less fked than ours at this point
That‚Äôs a lot of face masks !
"Have you seen the flooding there when it's just the beginning of the season?

2020 has more surprises in its pockets I would say"
Interesting  from Baillie Gifford explaining the pros/cons to Nio [https://insight.bailliegifford.com/documents/institutional/ltgg-stock-slides/ltgg-stock-slide-nio-ins-we-0483/?name=ltgg-stock-slide-nio-ins-we-0483](https://insight.bailliegifford.com/documents/institutional/ltgg-stock-slides/ltgg-stock-slide-nio-ins-we-0483/?name=ltgg-stock-slide-nio-ins-we-0483)
"Still up +25% on my initial investment, but after a couple days of back sliding, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if it‚Äôs time to pack it in. 

September‚Äôs earnings call is still a long way off and there won‚Äôt be much meat left on the bone if this bleed continues."
"Support at 13, resistance at 15. Wait till teslas next quarter report and we will üöÄ"
"what are the core technologies that Nio can build a competitive advantage on? I can think of battery swapping, autonomous driving. Am I missing some?"
"Will be a very interesting day today. Literally been blood two days in a row, will be a third?

Bought some puts to hedge my capital. Selling the puts today."
I think this will pull back to 10-11 range before going to 20 range.Nio has some very dedicated shorters from my experience.
"Anyone else holding with 2022 calls? 

I‚Äôm holding 1/21/2022 $10C I bought last week

Who thinks this long play will pay out"

Market open fat dump.
thanks!
Added some call options today for short to mid term investment. Long term investment in shares was established already.
Thanks for sharing!
"I understand what you're feeling because I'm in a very similar place as you. I feel like it died out a bit, so I might shave off a bit and hold onto most of it because I'm hoping it'll go up within the year. Also, the drop only started on the 13th, so like 3 days ago. Plus, I got in at $5.99 with a few more through its increase haha. NIO has blessed me, so I'll be patient and loyal for now."
Nio Q2 on September mate.
Hopefully neos own quarter report in August will be strong enough to give it that boost after the tesla earnings hype dies down ( based on a strong earnings from them of course)
"Nio houses, leading Chinese premium brand"
"Nio also makes it's own motors (I think), not Nio itself but a subsidiary."
"Well, down 10% in PM.
Edit :13%."
Already at 11.7
Definitely keep that long term.
1/21/2021 $11C here. Not feeling very confident tbh
"It will - if not today, later on."
"I got in early-enough that I can certainly weather a few more hits, but EV‚Äôs in general are running hot and I‚Äôm ever cautious about being caught up in an eventual burn-out. This being a CHN-based company hasn‚Äôt done much to assuage those fear."
But Nio follow Tesla!
thanks
:( how can we trade lower than ipo day.
Have 8000 stocks at 5 in this. Probably gonna hold for few more years. This pull back is needed to shake out robinhood investors and all other noobies. Probably gonna add a lot more if this fall bellow 10.
Because it‚Äôs a dump
Highly doubt it‚Äôs going below 10 unless a global economy crashes
Why dump? Sales records.
Seems to have very strong support at 13. We need some good news and better overall market to go higher
"Look at IDEX other stocks like this, it‚Äôs following the exact same pattern."
NIO is not like IDEX in any way. You can't compare these two.
"What I‚Äôm saying, is that it‚Äôs got the pump and dump pattern."
"It follows Tesla's movement exactly, that is the only pattern you can compare NIO to.

What I expect is 95% of what people see/hear about this stock is vocal Robinhood traders with $200 stake in the stock looking for an overnight payday and bugging out on reddit everytime it dips 4%.  This stock is up 90% for the month, and down 15% for the week.

Just sit tight, let Tesla do the heavy lifting, and we will be at $20 next week.

Edit: what a difference a day makes... NIO has officially derailed from following TLSA's trend as of this morning(Friday).  [Not looking good for the next few weeks](https://i.imgur.com/Xsq9b3P.png).  We have quickly gone from down 15% for the week to down 28%"
"So what should an investor do when the company releases record sales and going from nearly bankruptcy to soon being profitable. Should an investor dump? Sure, in a company as Nikola that doesn't produce anything, I understand the dump. But not in NIO? Also, do you really think NIO should be valued below 20B having the whole China to conquer?"
"Just keep your head cool. If you're in for the long term, it's just an occasion to buy more. The whole market looks down anyway."
"I've been invested in high volitlity stocks for 3 years now. Best advice I can give is this: holding long is possible but is a lot less financially painful if you have positions for the volitile stock in a few different accounts. That way you can sell off one position, taking profit after a huge run loses momentum and shorts take a dominant stance that bulls can't counter. You can hold the second position if you feel your price average is exceptionally low and wait for momentum to return (don't try to pick the bottom to buy more... rarely works unless you are really good at reading charts). With momentum clearly returning or strong ER news, start buying back in with the account you sold for profit taking. Don't be afraid to sell for profit. Don't put yourself in a bind where you are holding bags and have to average down."
"‚Äú K , lets go to the MOON ... oh wait I‚Äôm already there , go back now‚Äù"
üòÇ
LOL SO TRUE
"NIO should hold very well amid LI IPO. While TSLA is facing both pressure from high end (NIO EC6) and low end (Han, BYD with blade batteries)"
"Not sure on the margins but they have paid JAC 604 million RMB (in total since their contracts started). They pay JAC for each vehicle produced on a monthly basis. I believe their contract will end in 2022 so they may be getting their own manufacturing plant then.

Advantages are that they can start selling cars much quicker than they would if they had spent the time and money on developing their own manufacturing factory. Currently there is a lot of market share to grab in a quickly growing market and time is a factor at play.

Disadvantages are obviously the margins being lower for the short term"
"No idea on the margin but with using it as a 3rd party manufacturer, main  advantage comes from neo not having to spend a lot of money on creating and maintaining their own assembly lines especially while their actual production volume is still relatively low. 

Another advantage is that I highly imagine that neo will have a clause in the contract between them saying if Jac has any manufacturing problems for neo cars (perhaps a fire on the assembly line shutting production down) they should have a compensation clause to neo for failing to deliver on time.

Of course, that leads to the disadvantages where any manufacturing issues are completely out of your hand and if there are any, something that wasn't your fault will reflect badly on you.

Obviously jacs production margins margin

Another problem that I could see is volkswagen as they are looking looking to take a controlling share in Jac and whether that would impact the neo Jac relationship relationship"
"My understanding is that Nio is trying to leave the expertise of manufacturing cars to the legacy automakers in china, and focus on trying to be a major supplier in EV drivetrain, EV software, battery swap and battery management system. The subsidiary that is doing this for them is XPT Global. I wonder what is the pick up rate for their tech in the industry, because if they do well on that front, it'll make Nio very strong. 

Seems like GAC and ChangAn motors are doing the same for them as a joint venture Hycan and Nio ChangAn. But I have no idea the details of the joint venture. There's lots of important details that I do not understand and it's a pain not knowing them as an investor."
"Totally agree on the point about being flexible on manufacturing output. I believe Nio is going to have another factory in AnHui under JAC to produce more cars. There's no lack of demand for their cars in china, the problem is they really have to ramp up production to keep up with demand"
"Or Volkswagen might go all for NIO. Too early to tell on that front, anyone is delusional if they think they will be allowed actual access to the Chinese market. The taxes on them put them way out of the reach of most Chinese."
"Seriously. Mod needs to pin this to the subreddit.
People don't give a shit when you sell and you don't need to make a post about it. When you do, it's very clear that you are afraid of the stock rallying after you've sold so you try to instill fear in the noob investors so you can buy back in at a dip. If you're not Baillie Gifford or Tencent, the fact that you sell has no relevance to the company or the stock."
"""I bought 17 shares at 10 and sold at 10.50 im so smart"" 

These dudes are annoying.

I watched this stock fall all the way down to 1.37. Gotta have balls of steel to invest."
"100% agree.  Look at Baillie Gifford; bought 100m shares in 2018, still holding.   Full disclosure:  I bought in Feb (2020) and don't have a sell date."
Agreed man.
"Bought 20,000 shares  still holding"
Do people even care about the actual company and cars here? I tried posting a couple questions about them and only received a downvote. I guess I need to somehow relate my questions to day trading and perhaps I‚Äôll get a better reception.
I'm kind of late to this but I have a question. I recently started investing and bought NIO shares. If I only hold and not sell is that something I still have to report on my taxes ?

NKLA is just insane. Forget about it unless you just want to gamble.

Yeah that's pretty correct. USA Investors add a lot more value for domestic stocks then foreign. You can see the difference between baidu and google. Still i prefer China because of a lot bigger potential and more stable government support.
"lol. that said, american dream is sweeter."
"Ooooh the latest NKLA shill account! You don't even alter the writing style! Lazy fraud...

Nice share filing, by the way. Gotta love the Friday night filings. Classic."
???? Plz explain
"Go look at the account history and posting history of KaiserCyber and this asshole. It's likely the same person, certainly the same syndicate, hired to go around promoting NKLA everywhere on social media and investment forums. It's done to drum up trading volume. The real nasty ones are drumming up volume in front of bad news. In this case, NKLA just filed Friday night that a massive amount of shares from current insiders at the company are going to soon be sold, which puts a large downward pressure on the stock price to the benefit of insiders as they cash out. A pump and dump. Normally these tactics are only seen in penny stocks, but we are in a free for all trading environment."

Sold everything yesterday.

Buying at 15 - feel sorry for you man."
"Dude, sell FAST. It's going to be $10 tomorrow lol."
lost like 20% of my portfolio with it lol
That is bad advice. You will always lose your money if you buy peaks and sell dips
There is not much news.. so will probably go sideways for a while.
"Technical play. This will consolidate into the 9EMA on the daily. 

Once sell volume drops down we will see an outside green candle on volume greater than the 20day moving average. This will initiate the upward reversal which will continue until buying volume declines on the daily chart."
"I‚Äôm actually hoping for it to drop more these days so I can get more at a cheaper price. Either you trust your DD and hold, or you don‚Äôt and get out. Doesn‚Äôt matter"
[deleted]
Doesn‚Äôt look good today boys
Sheewwwwww boy looks like im in it for the long haul
"I think this is the big rug pull. Im pulling out.

Jk i was tricking the bots."
"Struggling to hit 13.50 all day haha. Welp, I'm sure it'll recover next week but this week I expect this to stay around this level"
The next catalyst might be tesla revises its model Y price in China?
[deleted]
Agreed. But it should be reassuring to investors that it seems to have formed a base at these levels. üöÄ delayed
Tesla news coming soon might pull Nio together. I honestly don't really understand why Nio is so closely related to Tesla in stocks.
"So, in English for everyone else :)?"
YupüòÇüòÇ
Weatherman
Might be the time to get some calls
"Dont blame you for securing profit. Thousands of early investors are probably doing the same, which contributes to the pullback. Once the news about model EC6 comes out, which is due this month, the price might soar again."
"only 300% ? Im holding my 8000 stocks for 5 usd till its 50 or more. I don't blame you for taking profits, just did plenty similar mistakes in the past and not doing again."
Love how you got downvoted for taking 300% profits lmao
Take your $150 and gtfo üòÇ
Well I think Tesla is proving the demand for EVs specifically in China.. so it would make sense they would follow along.
"As soon as everyone is done dumping/selling for the day, you will start to see an increase in buying ,price and volume will go up? I think that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs saying....üôÇ"
"After each two week long blast up, it poots sideways til it hits the 9 day exponential moving average. When the daily volume is low, yet the price hovers around the 9EMA, it is consolidating. When volume rises with price, the trend is in."
You can make a fortune by selling calls each week!
i dont do calls. only stocks
For 300 total cost I would hold the fuckers forever haha. it's a small gamble that can prove to payoff much later.
"Id say go trust your gut or do your homework. things may vary due to your own risk tolerance. To me, still a long way for nio to realize its gain. but the path is rather clear.

wish I had..."
Hold on as long as you can. This ride starts again when Tesla reports  quarterly earnings  on July 22nd.
Sell enough to cover your investments and hold the rest.
I suggest you hold for long term
"In at 2.42 for 4500 shares
I‚Äôm crazy I know but I sold enough to cover my original investment when it hit 15.00

The rest I‚Äôm gonna look to gains over the next five years as my outlook for this stock!   I believe they have a good future and PAD investing can‚Äôt disrupt that"
Why are so many kids investing in NIO all of a sudden?
What do you mean by that? Technically you cant invest if your a minor. It‚Äôs quite a heavily traded because it has a lot of potential.
Everything is down. Tesla is 7% down. Chill man.
"Go and look at the long term chart for TSLA, you will see some people had huge loses in the short term but the long term they've done very well. To be clear, I am NOT saying the same will happen with NIO, it may do, it may not - but the only way to potentially benefit from any upside that may come is to hold."
I'm so confused with this reaction? it didn't even drop that much... Stocks go up and down it's sort of what they do lol
"People, even if it drops below 10, keep cool. It happens. It will most probably go back up, sooner or later."
Please sell so I can buy more. Thanks for your sacrifice
Why is it doing this?
Please use the daily discussion.
Only betas sell
The dump is here.
True I'll wait till open and see what's poppin
"Literally 100% normal that the stock goes down. If you look at the stock every day, it would give you a heart attack. If you look at it 1 year or more. Then higher chance of profit. Think long term. I bought NIO at 10$ at the very beginning of NIO. A couple days later it went down every day. My NIO was down 50-80%. I just did not sell. Then wait 2 years.. profit."
Tensions. The Orange man hates ChYna.
Pump and dump
"Yes sir , I am dumping tomorrow."
Hope its not to late. Already at 11$
Was about to cross post this myself lol.
Where's the original source?
Where's the original source?
It just seems like some of the people who are posting have little stock market experience.  If you are a day trader...then you know stocks go up and down even with no relevant news.  If you are new at this...stocks go up and down even with no relevant news.  Stocks don‚Äôt just go up...even Tesla sometimes goes down.  And really it should go down.  And yes I own Tesla and NIO.  I also own other stocks.  I think people entering now think the stock will only go up..and if it goes down it is over. That isn‚Äôt how this works.
Yeah we really need to increase the quality of posts in here. A lot of WSBetters coming in new with investors. The post should not be allowed to be posted if they have failed to show any attempt at DD
"Seriously, people asking why is if dropping. If your new to investing just stop and watch some videos. How the hell would we know stocks go up and down so if there isn't an announcement its people taking profits or the markets down thats your answer 99.9% of the time. Geez"
[deleted]
Yeah lots of moderation is needed. I'm seeing irrelevant posts and posts hoping for NIO to plummet.
"Please. Its hard to watch so many emotional filled posts. Those kind of posts influence people who are not intelligent enough to have done DD and even while that's their own fault, its hard to just sit and watch it happen. Proper moderation would be extremely helpful."
[deleted]
LMAO
I bought 3000 shares at $11.90 FTW
"Incorrect. I'm not sure where you're getting your information from, but I've been trading for 20+ years and stonks only go up"
"It's been a helpful litmus test against my own optimism for Nio. I know the stock is due for a pullback when the stock kiddies start feverishly posting stuff like ""How high will Nio go?"" or ""How long are you holding?"" That's when I know it's time to sell a portion of my position, take profit, and wait for the dip. I sold half my $10 2022 calls on Monday and will re-enter around the same time they start posting about their losses."
"That's what a daily or weekly discussion post would be for.

20 new posts per day with no value added, it's not really interesting and we can end up missing a real info.

There is only 2.1k members and it's already starting to be annoying imho."
"We should have at least 3 weeks in the sub before one can post too.

Edit: deleted comment suggested to have a karma limit for posting."
"Enjoy going through my profile kiddo.

See I was cool before you!"
Please send me these stocks.  I have money to invest.
Agreed. People whine over a small pull back!! Started to think they're just FOMOing and wish to get rich quick. Probably have no idea what a correction is!
"You‚Äôre right, you described the problem a month ago. And the problem is more exacerbated today. Excellent problem solving skills ;)

Also it‚Äôs just funny to see the type of person that sends hate comments on reddit üòÇ"
Stocks go up and down a lot.  It‚Äôs sort of what they do.
"'stonks only go up' - such a scary thing to read, we are definitely in a bubble"
The amateur day traders have arrived to this sub !
"Why can't it go down until my pay day? 

Oh well, I guess I won't be adding any time soon"
Broader indexes all going big green
"As a newbie, this legit terrified me lol"
"Moved upto 150 shares today with the dip, stonks only go up right?"
mostly shorts in yesterday and today and todays volume.
kangarooo market
"If anything, I‚Äôm hoping for a big dip"
Was hoping it stayed low until tomorrow. Im transfering money to buy more shares.
Fuck me man... Glad I held on.
I BOUGHT AND IM SO HAPPY HOLY SHT I WAS LIKE THIS CAN TANK MORE OR IT WILL RECOVER. :)
"Shhh, we don't say such things here."
Yup. Green for like 14 days in a row. One red day and they start 100 notes on this sub
"Exact same dilemma here. I made bank on NIO since January, and I'm the wealthiest I've ever been, but most of that wealth is tied up in their stock and I don't have expendable money until my next paycheck"
No.. no they don't.
Ditto
"If you have robinhood, they should let you have instant deposit"
held on?  for what?  longer than a day?
i still believe in NIO but geez lol
"Seriously. Anything before September 22 is minor. Monthly sales reports hopefully stay positive, the rest is noise. It‚Äôs a volatile stock it was when this group has half the members üòÇ"
"Be careful mate. As much as I like Nio, it's not wise to put everything in one stock. To be honest, Nio is just one of my many ""fun"" stocks. I like them long term and I do believe they have potential hence my willingness to buy"
"It's a commonly used meme/joke, if you aren't familiar. While there's an element of believe in this expression (we all like to believe our stock will go up), nine times out of ten the people saying it don't mean it"
"Yeah I've been in this for a while, I'm not trying to trade and lose my money."
"I'm only working with about 4k, of which 1.5k is mine and the rest is profit. I want to expand my portfolio, but need to save up for a another few months before I can afford to invest again. Appreciate the advice though, I am trying to be super careful as I'm new to this game"
"This isn‚Äôt a day trade, bud."
"Plenty of new investors who decided to get into $NIO but aren't sufficiently experienced to realise that there are going to be bad days, weeks or even months too. Imagine buying at $10 last year only to see it at $3 and now at $14 again"
[removed]
Volatility is normal. People selling for gains.  Just add to your position in the dip if you bought in at $10+
Main reason I see is that we have a lot of new Robinhood traders that came in on the hype and got rekt on entry.
Most are robinhood investors I presume. They need to realise it's not going to go up everyday.
"Lmao I haven't invested \*yet\* want to analyze this more however I've been following this stock. They all want this to be a get rich quick thing and are getting just insanely greedy. Some dude I saw bought at 4, held 2 years and sold at 12 and people are all dogpiling him. Everyone is being greedy right now and shocked when stocks do what stocks do, bounce. Pigs are meant to be slaughtered."
"Thanks for your sacrifice, I just bought more"
If it shoots up to $20 it won‚Äôt be the only thing shooting my guy
Thank you for your sacrifice.
"Should have bought more. It‚Äôll moon. Bailee Gifford expects a price point of 300, not just 20."
I bought plenty more of Nio today.
Thats why i dont put stop loss. Sell the rally and buy the dip.
Thanks I‚Äôm buying 1000 now
Planning to hold tight! It‚Äôs a long term investment for me and will not be surprised if it goes north of $50 over the next 6 months
Ok
Bro we are green now smh
"this is why its so easy to make money on this stock, its crowded by beginners"
"Same here, idk about this week guys, seems like a trap both ways"
i sold the majority of mine at 12. was holding it for 2 years at 4$. i'll hold onto a little just in case it does well.
"I sold about 10 mins ago. Right choice as the price continued to dip. Still made a modest profit. Plan to buy back in when dip is over

Edit: bought back at a good price"
Same... I‚Äôve been bleeding out holding in hopes but I‚Äôm probably not as bad off as same since I kind of just got back into trying to learn stocks
Isn't it only Bailee Gifford who has the 300 target price?
300bln market cap? What thing was he high on? That must be good
One of these days there‚Äôs gonna be no dip and you would‚Äôve shot yourself in the foot by selling the rally. I.e TSLA
"I just bought more, I have the same mindset!"
"Hey zephyrdiamond, could you explain what you mean? Confused"
At 12? When holding for two years? I don't want to be mean but why the hell did you do that for?!
Congrats! You sold when the dip was over
Bought back in. Up 0.5% üòé
"Same boat. I put about ¬£500 in recently and I‚Äôll just sit on it for ages, surely go up at some point"
Yes. More analysts need to start doing target pricing for NIO. Would help tremendously.
"Seeing as how China intends to support its only local premium electric vehicle company, it‚Äôs safe to say it‚Äôll be good. Also, the car consumer market is much bigger in China than it is in the US. I fully expect NIO to be the preeminent dominant automaker in China in the foreseeable future. 

When you look at car sales globally, China has the most cars sold there per year, and IIRC they have nearly as much drivers as we have people here in the US."
Too good to be true I think
He's not greedy. He got 3x what he originally paid for. That's pretty good
It was one of the first stocks i bought ever. And now i know that i want the majority of my stocks to be safe dividend aristocrat stocks... so now i just have a smaller percentage in nio.
My profit on the buyback disagrees with you
"I also put ¬£500 in NIO , luckily I hit it right and got a good head start before it started to dip. This is a long term hold. High risk, hopefully high reward! Good luck everyone"
My problem I guess is I‚Äôm trying to learn options so I made a call on NIO that expires Friday that‚Äôs causing me to bleed out coupled with a call on CHGG that‚Äôs a little longer term. If i lose out a good bit more I may execute the strike for the shares on NIO with the intention of sitting on them long term to recoup but not sure if that‚Äôs the best course of action at this point in time
"So if that's the case, why have you written ""many analysts""?"
"Not to be that guy but NIO is not the only local premium electric car company. There's Xpeng. We can't discount Geely and BYD either (They have a sub brand called Tang which is more upmarket). Byton is moribund so yay!

If it were up to me, I'd buy Xpeng shares too. Even my Dad has heard of Xpeng."
"Well now that you make me think about it, China is pretty big, so if that‚Äôs going to become the n1 chinese carmaker, with also EU and NA market. That could make sense. Idk about chinese drivers, but if you take account of the growth china is having, they‚Äôll easily surpass US drivers. China is like 4/5 times US population right?"
Keep at it bud!
I‚Äôm 2 weeks into trading and all I‚Äôve heard about options is to stay away until you have substantial spare money and are ready to take the time to learn. Best of luck to you buddy
"You‚Äôre right on that, I edited my comment."
"It‚Äôs more like 3-4x but yes, and the Chinese Party intends to support NIO, giving them plenty of credit lines, telling their own citizens to buy stocks in NIO. They won‚Äôt let it fail if it can be helped."
Yeah that‚Äôs the way it seems. My sisters boyfriend is involved in a private brokerage here and consults on algotrading. I consulted him after the fact which was probably a dumb move but he‚Äôs supposed to be bringing me one of his old college textbooks this weekend so hopefully I‚Äôll be able to do the necessary study soon enough. Same to you!
"Also due to the battery swapping, the price limits on the usual ev incentives don't apply so say for example they have a $40,000 limit on the max price of the car to qualify for incentives where they'll take a few thousand off. Neo could make a $60,000 car and  the incentives will still apply to it. But yeah knowing China, they will do everything they can to stop a western company taking up the premium Chinese ev market"
Isn‚Äôt US population ~300mln? China is 1.4bln
"Devotion is a good thing and I guess you can never know too much so that‚Äôs good! Gimme a DM if you ever want an opinion on something if you ever want an outside opinion, always helps!"
I was under the impression China‚Äôs population was 1.2 billion and not 1.4. So yeah it would be 4-5x.
I was expecting it to pump up to $19 after the news..
What news?
I‚Äôm holding $15c 7/17
Pretty sure he‚Äôs referring to tencent upping their stake
Yeah what news LOL
Over the last couple of days I have been testing post flairs. Please start getting in a habit of using these and provide feedback.
"I am planning on starting a pinned investors discussion thread on Monday. Depending on your feedback, I will likely keep this up until Friday and continue this weekly. Possibly having another weekend discussion thread for investors. Keep in mind this subreddit is currently not just for discussing $NIO stock, but the company as a whole and we welcome posts from NIO vehicle owners."
Wasn‚Äôt there around 500 people on this sub a week or two ago. Now we have 2k and a daily discussion
"Maybe the mods can make a flair for those who joined the subreddit early, $3 gang or something like that hahaha"
[removed]
"I decided to pull out my initial investment.  letting my profits ride! I would keep it all together, but ive put my entire savings in this. Cant risk it all."
Thank you Dan.
I will be starting a mod search within the next week. More details coming soon.
Thankyou for your work Dan!
"Weekly should be enough considering how little news there is about NIO in general (I've been following it for a year and half or so).

If you need help deleting the useless posts, I can give a hand."
The last month we have been growing rapidly. It wasn't that long ago that r/Nio had no members and I made a request to takeover.
$1.50 gang
"China has two mainland stock exchanges, Shanghai and Shenzhen. Hong Kong stock exchange is also large. Nio is not traded in any of these yet. They have announced that they may ipo in China in the future but as of right now NIO is only traded on NYSE."
"wish it was me :( had some positions at $3+ and then some at $2+, but hey just happy for the gains anyway :)

it's the 2nd stock that i'm having this much luck with too, was and am still holding on to AMD since 2016"
Morning dip <$13 was no brainer. RSI has cooled down. Its going to go up both in the short term and long term
I‚Äôm buying more NIO and also a bit of Tesla
Can someone Explain to me like am 5 why?
"Tesla will do good on earnings report which shows how much money they brought in. When Tesla does good, NIO does good too so they‚Äôll both go up together."
"Could be 15, could be 12, today doesn't matter, a year from now does"
People really should stop looking at (and trying to guess...) short term movements. No one knows what will happen in the short term. I look at things like this : are they increasing sales? Are they entering a period of time where profit looks likely? Have sales plummeted? etc. Keep an eye on this  - [https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases)

"It won‚Äôt drastically. If there was, institutions would have sold off the stocks in large amounts today."
Do you have a link on this new law?
Probably not.
I'm assuming this is in regards to what happened a few weeks ago.
which thing? so many things happened
"It'll be alright, just some short term accumulation, the stock will do well in the long term!

DIAMOND HANDS TILL $100

edit: looking at [robintrack](https://www.robintrack.net/symbol/nio) we can also see investor interest building even higher, I wouldn't be too worried as the sentiment is still building for this stock"
"Relax.. if you thought 2 weeks ago it would be at 13/14 you would be very happy.. NIO will take time and earning not until sept 22. They are expecting positive GM and increasing production to 5k units per month. 

Also I think they are announcing price/specs for their next car in July.. productions starts in Sept."
I‚Äôm just gonna buy more at open soon.
Do you expect to get rich quickly from buying Nio?
It's crazy how popular this stock has been getting
"I expect to see the price keep fluctuating at the same levels for a couple weeks before we see it truly moon, can probably get in a few good swings."
"Yes, the answer is yes I do."
"Looking at data on investors holding between yesterday and today, it‚Äôs up from about 269k to 280k right now"
It's crypto all over again. It is going to be volatile as fuck for quite some time.
Just hang in there
It is. So was Tesla. I'd say Nio is a few years behind TSLA in terms of volatility. Even TSLA is still very volatile these days.
The whole stock market went down today. Lackluster earnings report especially by banks.
Lol relax
Get out weak hands
[deleted]
Welp now it‚Äôs positive
üòÖ
I did! Thanks for advise :)
"I got a little worried with US congress ending the audit deal as well as the new start up EV maker Li auto listing soon, I felt it‚Äôs not an exclusive stock anymore and the competition will be fierce... I confess it may have been hasty decision."
Must suck selling the dip..
Imagine how pissed stockholders would be if the government pulled some junk like that. This needs to be implemented but I really hope companies just do it on their own as an act of goodwill.
"Haha, it does, but I made 2500 so I am not complaining :)"
Rookie numbers.
Where are you seeing they are dumping the stocks? Go look up institutional buyers and sellers. Investment House LLC bought 150k shares yesterday
It went up 60 percent in a week. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs retail sell off too.
Where would I find live time data for institutional buyers and sellers?
"Where are you seeing 60%, I‚Äôm only seeing 40% at highest point in a week. Maybe because you‚Äôre using margin?"
By doing your DD.
No. But I‚Äôve been in a while. It went from 9.67 to 15 in a week (Friday to Friday). I didn‚Äôt use a calculator but that‚Äôs pretty close to 60.
You take the time to write a dick response but instead could have helped them. Nioiceeee
I have 8000 shares at 5. You guys have really weak hands. Pathetic
Pipe the dips ass n buy more
It‚Äôs a correction expect red tomorrow too. People often look at the short term but forget in the long run you‚Äôll be making money
"Me: buys share

NIO : Dips"
How many of you guys were around when it was less than 3?
"I held from $13 to $2.61 got margin called, and still held"
Fuck you are gonna walk away a winner. Congratulations on the retirement sir
Rookie numbers.
"Me : buys at 9.6

Also me : sells at 10 cause pussy

Me two days later : buys at 11.5

Also me : sells at 11

Bought today but finna hold"
"I got my feet wet with $300 @ 3.10 cause my friend wouldn't shut the fuck up about this stock every day, still don't know where he came across it.  Two days later it was at $5 so I put another $3000 in.  Now I'm +$4600, got my initial investment out and just riding the profits long."
lol im only 25. I was thinking selling when it reach 20 and wait for the pullback. Market is really pumped right now thats why we ended in red today.
I cant argue with that.
"Jesus, you probably shouldn't be trading stocks"
Lmao I was literally that friend for so many but few listened.
"Fuck I'm 25 and I had 550 shares lol. I sold at 15.90, realized some gains, and I'm probably gonna buy more since it dipped. Congrats, I'm sure this shit is gonna fly for you!"
How did u had 40k to buy stocks at 25
Probably but who should
The best you can do is just forget you have stocks. Im trading for some time now and i had plenty of regrets selling to early into the hype. NIO only came back to IPO levels. So i think 30-35 is not out of the question for the long run.
And that‚Äôs just what he has in NIO lol.
Ahahahaha lmao he tried slip that passed us
Earned/borrowed 10k. Invested in AMD and then in Tesla. Got pretty lucky. Hopping to be a millionaire by 30 ;)
"You're right, it's crazy business"
I have 80% of my stock portfolio in NIO ;)
"I like your faith, I hope it works out for all of us!"
it worked yesterday. Im quote happy.
Def red... right along with Tesla.  What charts are you looking at?
"Bruh we are green after hours, by 3.54%... I did not mean we would end up green net of today's loss."
"Oh.  Yeah ok.

So from what I'm reading about wtf happened to Tesla today, investors got hit with margin increase notices in anticipation for S&P inclusion.  Brokerages are trying to make more shares available by raising margin requirements on retail investors forcing them to sell shares or add more funds.  Etrade for example gives you the chance to sell off shares, or eventually just does it for you.  Sounds like all the big money out there proceeded to to sell off quick, leading to a bizarre first I can think of situation where a stock that rose $200 a share single day in premarket, then ended red.  In theory, money will all start pumping again leading to Tesla's earnings next week and buzz about S&P inclusion.

https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/20/07/16588999/why-tesla-margin-requirement-changes-could-be-a-buying-opportunity

https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hqkyqp/this_is_why_tsla_went_down_today/


I am still convinced NIO just follows TSLA stock movement to a tee, rides all the same spikes, and all the same dips.  So here's to hoping TSLA takes off again and holds over the next week and brings our baby NIO along for the ride."
"Damn that's a really interesting take! Thanks for the info, TSLA did end the day up 2% after hours (so I think this is pretty much a one day thing as you alluded to). Yeah we track Tesla quite closely if they do well we do, hoping for a good earnings next week and we should see this continue to rise, this week could be choppy but I'm confident it was a one day thing."
"My only near fuckup this whole month was my weekend plan to finally secure profits of NIO first thing this morning of all mornings, it's been a hell of a ride but I have got burned not locking in profits a few times.  I got in $3000 a month ago at $5 and was +$4500 profit.  Planned to take out $3k and buy two shares of Tesla instead and ride the $4500 profit on NIO long.

Wasn't expecting Tesla's insane spike though, which happened after I sold NIO so luckily I got 3k out at $15.10, and thank god Fidelity makes you sit for a day for cash to settle.  Somehow I dodged two major drops.

Today was a wild day, hoping for a return to the ""norm"" 10% gains we have been having the past few weeks :)"
"Yeah, I'm trying to play this longer, I realized that tryna pick bottoms and tops is honestly a bullshit game with stocks like these so I set a target where I wanna sell half my position (around 20) if it reaches that point... So I'm just waiting around until that happens really LOL."
"I think it's really possible for NIO, they are poised to be a $35 a share company in a year, with everything looking on track right now, just as long as Covid/China/Trade War stuff doesn't get in the way.  

Tesla on the other hand is an absolute freak and no analyst can figure it out, it defies logic and continues to blow the roof off itself.  But I've been kicking myself the past six months because I always think it's peaked and then it takes off again.  I remember when Elon's goal was $420 and seemed so farfetched, then I remember thinking $1000 was the absolute highest it could possibly go a couple months ago , and then look at this morning it was at $1780.  At this point I would rather lose money than keep missing out, then at least have some closure.  I feel like it's unstoppable at this point, will probably have a massive split like Apple did in 2014 soon and just take off all over again.  Hopefully a year from now I can read back on this comment knowing I picked two winners."
"Agreed man, let's get this bread."

"If you look at the last page, all 4 signatures are Ma HuaTeng"
You say increased but the numbers go down. I'm missing something here
The op has only posted about Nio something seems off
">NIO holdings to 16.3% from 15.1%

[only link I can find on this posted 40mins ago.](https://www.streetinsider.com/SEC+Filings/Form+SC+13DA+NIO+Inc.+Filed+by%3A+Tencent+Holdings+Ltd/17105457.html)"
Tf is wrong with you it‚Äôs the Pre
He‚Äôs saying their stake increased from 15.1% to 16.3%.
Looks legit since it is an SEC form
smart people see you at 100$
Haha wow I completely misread that. My brain was reading from/to instead of to/from
"Yep, debating how much this will affect share price though. 15$ looks like max for NIO in its current position, though it‚Äôs currently up 2% premarket"
I kind of feel like we aren't gonna break $16 today. It honestly feels like we will dip somewhere into $14.
Broke $16 premarket
I wonder if it can stay there though haha
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è there it is again. People been saying this since $8.
Facts
It's possible. I'm definitely long on the stock.
Long is the way to go
You called it
I fomoed at 15.90 jesus christ
Long
"I called what? Because it went down? It has been like this for a month dude, you‚Äôre welcome"
"> I‚Äôm thinking about buying some more at close and just take profit at market open.

Hope you played that perfectly as you described.  Sold at market open, reloaded at close.  $13.85 close.  Good luck, in for long game. Go NIo!"
She is taking quite the beating
The car looks ugly that's all i got
"I've been following this. Definitely something we should be watching. Also, look at Fisker Inc. The EV marker is going to get very competitive quickly."
"Interesting! Got this from wiki page as well:

Tesla lawsuit	
On April 14, 2008, Tesla Motors filed a lawsuit against Fisker Automotive, alleging that Henrik Fisker stole Tesla's Model S hybrid technology and was using it to develop the Karma. Tesla's suit claimed that the design work done for the Model S sedan by Fisker Coachbuild was substandard, and that Fisker Automotive diverted its best ideas to the Karma.[79] On November 4, 2008 CNET News reported that Tesla Motors would discontinue its suit after an interim ruling in favor of Fisker et al.[80] A news release on the Fisker Automotive website stated that Tesla was ordered to pay US$1,144,285 in costs.[81]"
ü§£ tesla unwinding is the biggest joke I've heard in a long time. Tesla is going to 2k by earnings then going to sp500 what makes you think they're unwinding they are so far ahead that they're 2012 model is still more advance than anything any of the legacy automakers have today. Tesla is going to be producing single oiece molded frames robotaxis and level 5 autonomy . They still have the cyber truck and the semi industry. They are constantly improving battery technology and are a recognized utility company in some countries. Tesla spends ZERO on advertising because people want their cars who else can say that?
"Am I crazy for having my biggest concern be the looming economic downturn? 

Don't get me wrong, I beleive in Nio for 5-10 years, but 1-2 years is looking pretty grim for just about everyone. Everyone's having fun at home day-trading with their stimulus money now but the chickens will be coming to roost soon enough and when their shit hits the fan it's not gonna be pretty."
Nios biggest challenge is not having the proper leadership and R&D in place to build on current momentum
"The Tesla concern is two years away I‚Äôd say looking at Ford/GM/ Toyota plans and even then Tesla seems to have a niche competing against Mercedes BMW neither of which seem to have big EV plans. 

As for Trump, does he even know what he‚Äôs going to do next?"
lol
Not crazy.  But it seems the downturn is here already and the US is the weakest link.  The rest of the world seems to have its shit together significantly more than the us.
Haha cute name. Money can buy all that. They have some big money for now. Hopefully they will use it wisely. They cut when they need to.
Bro by the time ford and toyota figure out ev tesla is already on robo taxis eating Uber and lifts lunch . Even if ford and toyota figure out ev technology level 5 autonomy would have to be bought from tesla unless they are ready to spend tens of billions just to build an infrastructure to begin collecting the data. 2 years from now tesla will be 10 more years ahead of them. Ford has over 100 billion in liabilities right now same with toyota.
"Eh you‚Äôd be a stupid moron to bet against the US on economic downturn. 

If US sneezes, the whole world sneezes given that USD is the global reserve. To add to that, US usually recovers faster than rest of the world including the EU (see 08). The country can print itself out of the dam hole without seeing much inflation. I suggest you read modern monetary theory and take Buffets advice of not betting against the US.

There is a reason why the USD saw deflation couple months ago. World was hoarding it in fear of a global economic collapse. There isn‚Äôt a better place to park your money."
"I understand the runway Tesla has built in those areas, but at the same time, Ford is introducing the Mach E, which appears to be a great EV product.  Toyota's betting it's future on fuel cell and hybrid tech, so it's hard to compare them.  Maybe that will pan out.  Mercedes in luxury has said no more generations of ICE tech.  The point is, everyone knows the future probably isn't ICE, and are making preparations.  What Tesla and NIO don't have, is a need to maintain legacy operations for dead tech.  So financially, that does help them a lot.  

Re debt, the majority of F and Toyota debt, as far as I've always understood, is vehicle financing, so not necessarily the same kind of debt that we think of as ""bad"" debt.  

If the market is forward looking, it's hard to say at what point the market says, ""tesla, you've had your grace period, now we evaluate you as an automaker.""  I strongly think they'll unwind a bit in the coming several years.  But if I'm wrong that's cool too."
"I think your wrong about the lead Tesla has in autonomous driving. Five years ago ford had adaptive cruise, lane keep assist and park assist.  they dont want to take the liability of calling it self driving but you could likely survive taking a nap in a 2015 Edge. They just won‚Äôt be getting sued for it when your car hits a trailer it thought was a cloud."
"My guess is a lot of people on here are young -- at least they have youth on their side and aren't betting substantial life savings on TSLA and NIO going ""to the moon"""
"If the objective here is to determine if NIO is a good investment then it appears to me that this is a classic case of paralysis by analysis. There will always be unknown unknowns, and to not take action or do something because something ‚Äúmight‚Äù happen is a decision everyone has to make. So many unfortunately ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù themselves to death only to see opportunity pass them by. Unfortunately most do not take the time to read the annual report of a company which outlines all of the risks and opportunities and should answer most questions in detail."
"You need to do some serious homework on tesla listen to Ark innovations on YouTube and go back to the beginning no one is even near or on the same level NOT EVEN CLOSE! Don't be naive I was heavily invested in ford and let go of that turd already. Oh wow lane assist tesla has lane takeover, summon, live road mapping, over air updates,. FORD has no dividend 100 billion in debt eliminating cars and focusing on trucks meh. im good and sure they have evs coming out but it will not reach the growth of tesla or their technology advancements unless they pay tesla for the billions of miles they have been data collecting for over ten years and even then they need to figure out full autonomy. Every tesla sold has been collecting mapping data. Do you know how long it would take ford to do that? They haven't even started! now Tesla isn't even a car company they are a software and technology company. Ford will still be down and out 5 years from now Good luck with your ford bets. Ps for everyone's safety dont take a nap in a 2015 ford focus ü§£ü§£ü§£"
That would make sense
"> at least they have youth on their side and aren't betting substantial life savings on TSLA and NIO going ""to the moon""

im young and bet my life savings on NIO"
"> So many unfortunately ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù themselves to death only to see opportunity pass them by. Unfortunately most do not take the time to read the annual report of a company which outlines all of the risks and opportunities and should answer most questions in detail.

This answer summarizes the fear in NIO bears quite well and really should be pinned to the subreddit."
"I‚Äôm not talking about Ford Stock. I‚Äôm talking about Tesla not having anything close to a monopoly on car tech. Elon Musk is however probably CEO who talks loudest. Ford kills Tesla in sales right now and there stock still sucks, they obviously don‚Äôt suck at customer retention. Would Toyota have been a better example? Also if a company sells 10x as many cars can‚Äôt they collect data 10x as fast. GPS isn‚Äôt very exclusive tech. I also made a point to mention the year 2015. Fuck a 2020 KIA has over the air updates.  MWhat car are you driving to think Tesla is the only car with internet?"
"There are tons of companies working on automated driving not just traditional automakers so the idea that conventional automakers can't compete with Tesla in the autonomous field is laughable. All Toyota, Ford, Honda, etc. need to do is acquire one of these companies, or even more likely the company with the best system will have some sort of lease/subscription structure for using the technology with automakers."
that seems fine. If you were old and bet your life savings I'd be worried.
If Nio goes down because of a market crash I'd be happy to buy more shares. The market is so crazy right now I don't even know if it will crash.
"For me, Nio is a go long or go home.

And by long I mean 10 years or more."
"I'm new to investing so I'm just setting trailing stop loses etc. so that I don't get fucked. But I'd take a portion of my earnings (I'm up 100% so far on Nio) and buy some shares back if the price really crashed. Nio themselves won't face much repercussions from a US crash so while their stock price might drop, the business shouldn't break stride."
Worried? I'm excited! I missed the first crash not this time
We are entering in EV era... I won't be surprised to see EV success growing in the market in the next decade. If you do not believe in EV than invest in oil and be afraid :)
 Short term most likely it will go down but in the long run it should go upwards
"Everyone now knows stock precies will go back up after a covid related crash, so less people will sell therefor prices will not go down (as much)"
"It's not a matter of if but when. The current bubble is fed by the central banks printing everywhere starting with the FED.

The next drop is going to be massive and they have already used all their ammos.

With the QE that they have done, the FED has literally killed the market/capitalism as there is no market right now, they buy and decide of the price of everything."
"All I have to say is.

**""Your Space Ship Is About To Blast Off""**

**""Your Space Ship Is About To Blast Off""**"
"Agreed. Gonna set up trailing stop loses to mitigate tits-up loses, but I'd happily take half my profit and buy more at crash price"
10yr price target estimate?
"No idea, hoping it follows a path like Tsla"
"cmon give me something to day dream about, it's monday"
$300 a share!   ü•¥
"$300 in 3 years, $1000 in 10"
"10 years to get it to $300???

I think we will see that much earlier"
Say you bought at 10: a 3000% return rate is pretty good for a sort of new stock for 10 years.
What the hell is this and why am I getting an alert for it üòÜ
Nio loves you too ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Woah there man, hands off my girl. Nio is mine"
Nio will never dump you
Never gonna give you up
"Having stock in Tesla, Nio and Arcimoto is very pleasant way to make a few $ these days. If I could invest in Korean stock I would add battery tech. But for now, I love my little EVs üòç"
It‚Äôs love don‚Äôt question it üòçüôÇ
Does arcimoto vehicles require a motorcycle license ?
"Don't know, I would imagine that they don't. But I'll never buy one. So I haven't checked."
I doubt Nio will be affected. I don't think they are reporting fabricated numbers.
"> Companies that use accounting firms that cannot be inspected by the  PCAOB for three consecutive years would be de-listed from U.S.  securities exchanges.          

it would still take 3  years to delist"
"No NIO won't be effected, they are already compliant and have an independent firm audit their financial results.  They don't cook their books like Lukin Coffee."
Why do you say this?
"That‚Äôs not the issue. As soon as it‚Äôs announced it‚Äôs gonna be delisted, the stock plummets. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it takes 3 years if you‚Äôre gonna lose money overnight"
It is really hard to fabricate car sales numbers as opposed to something like coffee. Also the fact that they are selling cars is quite evident on the road in china
"Also, car registrations are a real thing. I can‚Äôt tell you how many cups of coffee I had two days ago... was it 3? Maybe it was 4.... okay let‚Äôs just say it was 5."
"They're also audited by Price Waterhouse Coopers China, an accounting firm that has never been involved in a scandal."
A pretty valid question and you have the answer. I was gonna say registration and insurance as well.
"Also, their numbers are quite terrible (except for revenue growth) so if they were fabricating them, they would probably make it look a bit better."
"I dont own the stock only play options
would never be foolish enough to buy a Chinese ADR. So that doesnt really apply to me"
Just curious. What makes you choose Nio over XPeng or Tesla for?
"Lovely. I see an interesting phenomenon on the internet. Many seem to be raging against and looking down on the ES6 and ES8, except the actual owners. How is it? Was it a satisfactory EV of its price range?"
Fantastic üëè
Where was the location?
[deleted]
Really cool!! Thanks for sharing!
So do you prefer Nio over XPeng and Tesla because of the battery swap feature?  Because I understand that you can get the others for a cheaper price.
Do you see more Nio being delivered?
Are these operated by a person? I was under the impression a person wasn't neede
"Beautiful cars, I believe in $NIO"
How was the swap experience? Is an oporator running the swap or automated?
Xpeng ugly as hell
"Anting, Shanghai"
"I have it. You reserve the battery swap in it, but can also use it to open the car or pre-start air conditioner."
xpeng doesn't sell even 1/4 of the number nio sells
As compared to what?
See other comment in this thread!
Oh boy
"You reserve the battery swap on a location on the app. Depending on the order of cars (there may be a queue of 2-5 cars, or 0), the operator comes and sits in your car. He drives into to the booth. Not that easy for some drivers, I guess, because you need to reverse up a ramp and it‚Äôs not super big. The operator also initiates the battery swap. I guess there are 10 to 30 batteries on charge. Sometimes in rush hour they don‚Äôt have a full-battery available, they‚Äôll give you the choice: 80% full or wait 20 minutes. Depending on the next trip, 80% may be enough. And you can also always quick-charge it yourself. Some battery swap places are really at parking places: This one had a Tesla Supercharger station also, plus a McDonald‚Äôs. Others have a full-fledged Nio house with a lounge, caf√© and some merch for sale. The battery swap is free btw, included in the price of the vehicle."
"There are many videos of this, just YouTube it if you are curious"
On the roads in general I live in the USA so I can‚Äôt grasp their market share in terms of feel.
"My question is, how much can this be scaled? I see Tesla owners complaining that they show up to a charging station (way easier to build and deploy) and they are waiting for 45 minutes. These swap stations might work right now since they are only selling 4-5k cars a month, but what about when there are 300k cars on the road? They only hold 20-30 batteries. So only 30 cars a day get this luxury?

I don't see how this can be scaled without needing massive infrastructures to store and charge batteries."
"Thanks for your info. Its hsrd to get an honest account for this setup. This sounds far closer to a 'petrol station' set up and may make those big distance isses irrelevant if its scalable quickly enough.
It'd be awsome for another manufacturer to share these stations."
Just after a 1st hand account
There are definitely more Nio's on the road than before 2014.
"One thing is that at least with Nio you get both options: battery swap or charging. I think the scaling would come from most people just charging in the night, and battery swap just being used for long trips, which few people take ‚Äî but most parking spots in China don't have charging function yet. And yeah it's certainly a bit annoying, the car is sold with nice promises and sometimes you call ahead \*Do you have batteries left?\* and they say sure ‚Äî when you arrive 10 minutes later they say \*Sorry you need to wait 20 minutes for a full one\*. This is alright if you're at a Nio house with coffee, toilets and seats, but annoying if you're in a parking lot in the middle of nowhere and you just wish you had an old fuel car."
"
I'm also interested to know how a swap station handles the charging. Can they charge 20-30 at a time and do they have a faster charge rate then a supercharger without the need for a consumer friendly charger? If they can do all 30 at once at a high speed then by the time #31 comes the first one should be good to go."
"Nio is starting to charge for battery swapping for second-hand owners. As Nio sells more cars I think Nio will eventually start charging new owners for battery swapping as well, though probably not in the near future."
Cool. Hopefully we see profitability soon.
"Yea, that's the Tesla bait and switch move. Tesla advertised, ""free charging for everyone, forever"". 2 years later, ""eh, nvm."".

This service won't be free for long. My original question is still, how can this scale. Everyone says in China space is virtually non-existent. So what purpose will these serve unless they end up building massive drive throughs that can have multiple bays and do 100 cars or something. 

I love the concept, I just don't see how this can scale, besides being an ultra luxury. (meaning, you pay 5x than regular charging for a quick 5 minute battery change)"
 NIO was founded in November 2014...
"The thing is, with the situation in China, battery swapping is almost crucial for many owners. They just can't have at home charging. I think in the future, these swapping stations will be fully automatic and probably be more expensive for people to use. Also, very importantly, the Chinese government is giving strong support to battery swapping. With improvements in tech and these being fully automatic, I think they will work something out."
"The issue is still, you need HUNDREDS of batteries in a major city. How are you going to create a facility that can fit somewhere.

I'm really interested in seeing how they solve this. How long does it take to charge a battery from 0-100%? I can see them having made 100 battery banks, and but the time they get to the 100th, enough time has passed that the depleted ones are full and ready to go back in a car that's queued up."
Why not buy a gas station and convert the pumps into stations.
Great idea. I'm not sure about the scalability due to cost but I can see that being tested
Ugh... I hate seeing this kind of stuff.  Just no meaningful analysis and all hype.  Doesn't help anyone's case.
Nikola in the thumbnail... Downvote!
What‚Äôs up with the green bonnet?
"From my DD, I believe that July tends to be one of the worst months for car sales, and that has been historically true for Nio. So I would say that longer holds are better right now. Nio are due to make an earnings report on September 22nd so holding past that could be very profitable if sales are good. My feeling/ educated guess is that they will be."
September it is. I‚Äôm also holding onto 11 contracts for a $20 strike that I purchased for $99 back in 2019. Thanks for the help
Sounds tidy. Hope it works out :)
Has NIO announced the date for earnings yet?
Buy buy buy!
It‚Äôs also Tesla earnings call
"NIO has not formally confirmed its next earnings publication date, but the company's estimated earnings date is Tuesday, September 22nd, 2020 based off prior year's report dates.

First result on a Google search = Another quality post...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Its the speculative date as shown on TD ameritrade
"No it's not. Q3 is July, August, September so Q3 earnings would be 22-25/10"
"Ah, didnt see that. Perhaps its NIO with the strategic dating then. Curious to see the change or constant in corelation between the two as time goes on"
That's probably just random. They often are.
"Yeah it's hard to know who this benefits, if anyone. Might be completely inconsequential."
"Maybe just EV in general. One day, big attention all around."
"Yeah that's probably the most logical reason/outcome. Nio does seem to have been riding Tesla's coattails so it the extra EV attention is probably particularly good for Nio. I say this, but I'm holding positions on their stock so I definitely want to to be true lol"
no i think its a great long term investment. $15 today. could be $50-100 in a year.
"Invest as much as you're prepared to lose. I would suggest you to do a more due diligence on Nio and especially Chinese EV scenes. 

I wrote a blog post covering the basics :  [https://mybornean.blogspot.com/2020/06/creating-my-own-arkk-innovation-etf-1.html](https://mybornean.blogspot.com/2020/06/creating-my-own-arkk-innovation-etf-1.html) . Obviously, I'm not writing down all my thoughts there as I continue to learn something new. 

It's a still new company and in its infancy. it could pay off big but it could also go out of business. Competition in China is FIERCE.  I believe XPeng is the one to beat. Though, I am more inclined to think  the three semi luxurious car makers can make it in China (Nio, Tesla, XPeng). There may be more though. I don't always follow Chinese EV news. 

If you're thinking Chinese government invested in NIO. Guess, what even SOE can go bankrupt in China and the ""government"" that invested in Nio is actually the investment arm of Hefei municipality. Their goals is to make money. Does not mean that they will bail out Nio if it were to go under. 

Read up Country Driving : A Chinese Road Trip by Peter Hessler for an insight on how Chinese economy works. Do note that it was written almost 10 years ago and China has changed enormously. 

My post may look negative/bearish on Nio but I'm a long term bull. I'm just a little bit more realistic on it. I don't buy it can be $100 in a year or two but then again we can't predict the market. I mean, NKLA has more market cap than Nio for God's sake!"
What the guy above said. Just be ready to watch the value go down short term if a corretion happens. Stick to your guns in the short term. Last few weeks have been crazy...crazy good though! These new ev co.s are going to seriously disrupt the car market
"Not to be THAT GUY and I respect everyone‚Äôs opinion, but I wouldn‚Äôt call NIO a ‚Äúnew company‚Äù. Let me explain with an example. I think you know Koenigsegg, right? Well that was a total new company, started from the bottom, and now works with Volvo and Polestar, and kicks Bugatti‚Äôs ass. Nio never was a newborn company, the first years of their life they secured a safe place in formula e, and if this shitty coronavirus goes away and NIO wins races, that will give them lot of exposure. My point being: would you call a company in its infancy when it already has a safe place in formula e, and is supported by the government?"
"Never a bad idea to lock in some profits.  Stocks don't typically produce 170% returns in a month forever.  I bought $3000 last month which is now worth $7500, my plan is to take my original $3000 out  on monday and ride the $4500 gains I made long term.

This way if it doesn't work out I'm out nothing, and if it does keep going up, I'm still in more than my original investment for the long run.

I feel a lot of people here don't want to admit, a lot of the gains NIO has received recently are directly correlated to Tesla's stock price, which has also had a killer month.  I think NIO is still a great hold long term, but we are definitely at the top of the short term bubble.

[Tesla vs NIO chart for past 30 days](https://i.imgur.com/1T2qwGi.png)"
"Let me play the devil's advocate here. I don't think Formula E will give Nio that much exposure in China. Don't think that it's THAT popular in China. 

There's a big difference between local government (Hefei) and the central government I would think. Although I think what Nio is doing is in line with what the central government want. I just want people to look at Nio more objectively. Local government investment arm invested in Nio != Central government has a stake in Nio. If anyone is confused what the heck Hefei City Construction and Investment Holding Group is, think of it as a Sovereign Wealth Fund but owned by the city government. 

I stand by my statement that Nio is still a relatively new company. The next few quarters will either make or break them. They're getting capital inject + new line of credit. If everything goes to plan, they and a few more Chinese EV manufacturers will dominate car sales in China. At that point, they would probably taking export market seriously. What their stock price is will be anyone's guess. 

I'm in for the journey but I won't be betting my life savings there yet."
"In fact formula e will give them exposure abroad, that‚Äôs my point"
Thank you for sharing.
To the moooon we go!

Why is the stock going down
All caps title and google amp link... quality post there!!!
bad ass.
Dang I thought we would do a lot better but looks like the bulls handled the shorts! üí™üí™
konsolidation
Line fo Credit is not the same as a loan. The interest rates are much higher and there‚Äôs no set scheduled payments so they‚Äôd have to pay anything they borrowed right away to avoid paying high interest.
"Nooblade, my apologies as I was overjoyed with the thought of becoming a millionaire before age 30."
$NIO is backed by people with a high tolerance and high net worth. Long term homies
Do you have more than 25000 shares or you're 14?
Let's just say I invested at $2/share and keep it at that.
I'm in for the long run.
"I'm long on this stock.

Delisting will never happen for all the reasons that many have pointed out in multiple posts and discussion groups. 

I'm not even thinking of stock price, I'm judging this offering on its potential and rate it favourably when compared with Tesla. NIO has reached the point it has more quickly and much more efficiently than Tesla, it has a great product, and is in a position to become the leading premium EV manufacturer in China. It's literally the Chinese Tesla - noting that the Chinese tend to prefer Chinese products, so I think it will do very well. 

China is way ahead of the rest of the world in its wide-spread adoption of smart technology and infrastructure. There is also a government subsidy for purchasing electric cars, but the criteria to qualify just happens to exclude all EVs, with the exception of NIO. 

IMO, this is an undervalued and overlooked stock. It's unbelievable that people are buying NKLA stock (a company with nothing but an idea) for over $50, while this gem is approx. $15 at the time of writing. 

If you're in the stock market (any stock), you have to be prepared for it to fall as well as rise in value. I will be taking a long-term view and won't be obsessing over any dips along the way."
I just held. Praying for a green week next week üöÄ
Glad I held on to this one.  500 @ $3.66 tendies
In for long term. As soon as I get 100% gain gonna sell half and keep the rest for couple of decades
Holding strong
"Yes, bought 300 more shares today."
"Will be the 2ne hottest thing in 2020, other than my gf."
long long long
IM SAD THERE WAS NO DIP FOR ME TO BUYAT CLOSING. IS EVERYONE HOLDING OR SOMETHING. Lmao I ended up buying 10 at $15.
"I think I'm going to stay.....but I too am worried. Anybody know the soonest it could happen? Also if they are delisted, do we need still have shares? I thought I read that China wouldn't honor shares if the US delisted them."
I have options ex. on 17th. thoughts?
Buying more at the next pull back which I think will happen around $17-18.
"I'm the same man, got in at 12 with 88 shares and I don't know if I should hold much longer. People have so many mixed opinions on it. Don't know who's right or wrong"
My call is +700% profit. Contemplating since contract expires 7/31 lol
Staying strong with my 15 strikes
Holding out for the long run with my 10 measly shares...
"In at $4.00, sold half at $6.00. Bought more at $7.00. Holding long term"
I am. I may sell on Monday if $17 triggers my order.
"Shiiiiit, I've been waiting on a dip the past few days just to buy more!"
"I'm with you. I just did a quick check, NKLA is valued at 19B and NIO is valued at 17B. 

To put that into perspective, Nio already sells cars in China and they have showrooms in over 90 cities in China IIRC. 

That doesn't mean there are no risks tho."
Major Facts
well said.
Totally agree with you..... but for reference the stock price has nothing to do or show for the value of the company. It‚Äôs the perceived market value divided by the number of shares issued.... so you could have a very bad company with a higher share price and a Microsoft for less than a dollar
"I think this is the play. I'd have major FOMO if I sold everything before $35 or so, but if it hits even $20 I'll be, by my student standards, loaded"
Let‚Äôs see a pic
Stop waiting for the dip. It‚Äôs a long term investment
probably should‚Äôve waited until the dip monday morning but you‚Äôre good regardless.
The us/China talks are just a political campaign. No way they are going to go through with it.
"Dude this delist shit is not happening... Nobody even fucking read the actual statement no conclusion, nothing from the SEC. Stop listening to people just trying to scare you and are clearly short of the stock."
"I'm so tempted to pull out now. I'll have increased my fund by around 25% and my money is safe. The political stuff is worrying me... as are prospects of a dip

Edit: I ended up holding"
in the same boat as you - I‚Äôm banking on them announcing the credit and hopefully I‚Äôll make a couple thousand before selling
Why not just buy now then below 15?
"I'm in at 12 as well I have 1000 ish shares tho, however I'm holding at least until next month's delivery numbers unless something catastrophic happens. Stock is holding well today, and no signs of anything going wrong. Be patient."
10 Share Gang reporting for duty!
I‚Äôll buy more
I added 5200 shares today at $14.4
Wish I had rickety racks to put in haha but I've only been investing for 5 months
atta boy
Average cost?
"All G man I'm tryna pay off my student debt üòÇ I feel you, hopefully this shit hits 25."
There was no dip ahaha
"""they"" are saying it'll easy hit 30"
i would buy like right now if i were you. probably lowest it‚Äôll be all day.
Lol
If it hits 30 I'll streak across downtown.
Analyst median estimate is 34 and the high estimate is ¬£80 guess we'll just have to buckle up
Do you have any idea who tf these analysts were üòÇüòÇ that's some lofty projections
No haha I was just looking at CNN business site
LOL wtf... I mean anything can happen with this bubble of a stock market.
Tbh I see it flying on open
I've said to myself I'm cashing out at ¬£20 ish. Don't want greed getting the better of me
Hopefully man.

Yes good good
"The reversal back up after tanking down is immense. Like everyone is waiting to buy the dip. It seems like many, many people are aiming for the long term gains with more news to break over the next months"
[https://seekingalpha.com/news/3590168-nio-soars-to-new-heights-after-setting-up-credit-facility](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3590168-nio-soars-to-new-heights-after-setting-up-credit-facility)
Definitely
Is this even relevant???
Trying to be smart here! Jk thanks I know what you mean
"Also, can you elaborate more on this?"
I feel warm and fuzzy?
What do you mean by elaborate?
The stock could also plummet. I certainly hope not but this stock is a risk
Good point. I am asking for your opinion based on your conclusion as to why I should invest is all.
Stock is a risk?... you dont say?
"Invest in NIO? if you mean that I can‚Äôt give you a reason for YOU to invest. I personally invested in NIO because I was maybe one of the firsts too look at the company. Why I say this? Because I‚Äôm passionate of racing and I‚Äôve always watched formula 1, and since formula E came out I heard of NIO. I invested because of my passion and I saw innovation. No news no BSs whatsoever. No one told me to invest in it, i followed my gut. That‚Äôs why you should know if you want to invest. Either buy or sell, that‚Äôs your decision."
"There's always political risk which is why I prefer to invest in HKEX directly rather than NYSE anymore.  The worst case scenario would be Nio being banned and it probably could be relisted in HKEX.

I have an investment thesis on Nio (Speculative but still I believe in the company) and will stick with it long term (Doesn't mean I won't swing trade them if I see a chance). Most certainly will buy on a dip near my average price. I have averaged up a few times.

I don't believe Nio is a scam. If it were, i doubt Chinese state owned banks are loaning them 1.4 billion USD. Btw, it's a private company and even the investment from so called Chinese government is actually Hefei municipal investment arm. Think of it as a sovereign investment arm.  Frankly, I'm tired of the incessant demonisation of China and its government in reddit by using words like ""CCP"", ""Chicom"", ""Chinese regime"". And I'm not even a Chinese national!"
"So I read into this btw, literally just a roundtable talk, no real conclusion in order to execute on. Furthermore no large banks, large funds were involved. The Chinese are far too important to the U.S, if they do this and China's sovereign wealth fund pulls out of the U.S market heavily the U.S is fucked in real estate and economically."
Yes that also applies to Nio
"and if it does, what does it mean for investors?"
"Hoping that somebody with solid experience in the world of finance comes in to give their perspective, rather than just people who are xenophobic and/or retail investors with minimal knowledge of global economics."
"Just keep swing trading and enjoy the ride for what it is. If it isn't a scam (on the fence on that, it is American money they are after), all the better. If they turn out to be manipulating their sales data (which is common here), I will hopefully made my profit and moved on to something else."
"Not experienced, but I get skeptical after hearing what happened to Luckin Coffee $LKNCY. 

I too am on the same boat as you."
They have auditors. Checking these things. I think faking car sales may be more difficult than a cup of coffee.
"How many Luckin Coffee‚Äôs have we seen vs How many Enron‚Äôs have we seen? 

Not everything coming out of China is a huge scam waiting to be delisted"
Luckin Coffee was not backed by their government so its not even a close comparison.
It goes with what Warren buffet says. be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when people are fearful. People are fearful this is why the stock is undervalued. I‚Äôm long.
"Well thanks for the update, makes sense now."
"Please explain why you see ""so much potential"", then based on that answer, you have your own answer. It sounds like you are asking for advice on trading or in a hidden way, asking for approval to buy more. If you're in it for the long haul, buying now won't matter. $1-2 dollars won't kill you. Nobody can predict if NIO will crash 50% tomorrow, if we did, we would be rich already. 

If you believe in Bio long term, buy tomorrow and check back in a year and 1 day. That's when you can sell for lower taxes on your profits."
"Yeah I wouldn't try to time the market. If you anticipate a dip, then just use dollar cost averaging. This means just put in like $25 per day regardless of price.  That way if there is a dip, you'll make more money than if you went all in.  But honestly $200 isn't a lot of money, so there's not a lot at stake here.  Nio is bound to hit at least $20, but many people here are saying as high as $100 or even $300. But yeah, I would try to study as much as you can to become a more experienced investor. Overtime, you'll gain confidence in your own investing abilities."
"If you're new to stocks, assume you're going to lose money. I would buy a variety of different stocks, this will lower your risk to some degree but more importantly, you'll learn more."
Do some research and try yo learn a bit more and make an informed decision
"I‚Äôve only been around here for a few weeks but my recommendation is to input small amounts of money and work off a ¬£ to ¬£ basis for a while to get a feel and study the market/how it works. Also, I‚Äôd avoid selling at a loss if you know it‚Äôs going to bounce back. Don‚Äôt put more in than you can afford to lose buddy"
"Thanks man!! Let me tell you that I just purchased 0.25 shares of tesla right now. I want to get my foot in there so bad, hopefully I didn‚Äôt make a bad move"
"Thank you for your answer! I guess it kind of is approval, to feel out what you all think."
"Thank you! Def am learning more and following more stock pages. $200 is fine with me, I‚Äôll make that investment. I appreciate your answer!"
"I have a couple of very small ones, but I don‚Äôt know which ones are good. I‚Äôm learning daily and adding new ones to my watch list. My most expensive one is royal Caribbean lol it was my first buy thinking it may boom when tourism starts again, but idk, what do you think?"
"Anything impacted by Rona is a good buy. Airlines, crusies, oil etc... Look at charts from 6months - 1 year. Currently invested into 100 shares of GUSH. Going long on this one."
"The stock market right now is pretty wild, most experts seem to agree that we're in for a big crash but it's hard to say when exactly. If you're looking at long term, it really doesn't hurt to hold some cash because things likely be deeply discounted within the next 6 months to a year.

And this is a lame answer I know, but if you're talking about investing $200 I'm guessing you're young and don't have a ton of money laying around. Especially given the economic uncertainty right now, the investment that will give you the biggest return is your education. Whether that's formal education, teaching yourself coding, reading books relating to what you're passionate about and can lead you toward a successful career... Just figure out what you want to do with your life that will give you more money to invest."
Bro just seen that about a yr ago how much it was worth and gaaaawd damn
"Thank you for your response! I‚Äôm actually 24 and graduated with a BA, just not in stem lol I work for the county and make nice money. $200 is just my safe zone with stocks as to how much I‚Äôm willing to throw at once! Thank you again, I will hold on and see if things dip a little :)"
">I'm guessing you're young

> I‚Äôm actually 24 

lol

>and graduated with a BA, just not in stem lol I work for the county and make nice money. 

Oh, well damn good job! When I was 24 I was still dicking around and had no idea what I was doing. 

Still -- if you don't have a solid understanding already, study macroeconomics, politics, pretty much everything related to the world will help pick stocks. If your degree or career gives you any insight into a particular industry you can build on that."
"I saw their vehicles and their price, though not in person, yet I'm impressed and believe they will grow"
Great video! Very thorough.
I‚Äôd sell my shares at $90üòÅ
1 million
$30-$40 and I'll get paper hands
"When it makes sense to sell, whenever that occurs.  Dynamic situation all around, not a slave to price targets."
"I wouldn't touch NKLA with a barge pole. It seems like the next Theranos.

Meanwhile, NIO has a great product that is already selling, and an almost captive market  to sell to (especially with the government subsidy). A great combination. 

I think it's realistic for this to reach over double the current price in the short to medium-term, with great potential for significantly higher returns over the long-term."
"Set my sights on $150 in 3 years or so, if the company is in good shape then I‚Äôll probably carry on with my diamond hands while liquidating a little to celebrate how well it‚Äôs done"

"https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/ho1uty/chinese_news_says_nio_got_10_billion_from_banks/fxgiict

This comment from another thread in here is actually somewhat concerning. It is a similar rumor and I hope the rally today wasn't attributed to this."
Why would the rally being attributed to a positive opioid of NIO from bankers be a bad thing?
"They said today that they'd make an announcement tomorrow. Historically, their press releases have been around 4am EST. We'll find out soon."
"The article from Reuters (which is a fantastic source) is a year old. It was for 10 billion, same as the rumor today, and in the article it mentioned how Nio was having better success with it's business at the time the article was written. 

They recently just announced they are doing better and now we hear a rumor with the same number. I just think if it's false, like it was last time as noted by the time that has gone by from the publication of the Reuters article, then the stock price might adjust downwards. It's pumping up because of FOMO, so it is volatile as fuck. I don't doubt that they will announce something Friday but I hope the rumor isn't wrong. Don't get me wrong, I like their business model, but the increase of the stock is definitely thanks to FOMO. I am sure at some point the price will adjust (climb) more naturally but hype is driving this stock price up."
"That is 1am here in Cali, would you happen to know where this news would be posted when the announcement comes out?"
Definitely FOMO.
"Historically, their press releases are on their website's investor relations page. From there, news outlets will pick it up."
"Excited to hear that institutions are confident in the company as well, guess it would be yet another good night for those who hear about the deal"
"Can't believe how much people are negative about NIO in youtube...
$NIO is going to hit $20 then $30...
not going to miss this boat..missed Tesla ..missed Nikla..
not this one"
"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/uk.mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUKKCN1SY19K

Is this a fresh 10 billion or a report from half an hour ago about total past investments?
Sold on the battery swap!
I'm saving this. Interesting.
"Dang glad I saw this, time to invest in a few more shares"
Yes siiiirrrr
Put a few hundred pounds in during the dips today. Pretty pleased with the growth since then :)
This is not in english how can we verify this?
Got in at $5.15 did not expect to see gains this soon. But I‚Äôm not complaining
I got in at 4.50 sold at $6 hahahahaha but I‚Äôm enjoying some gains on those $10 calls
I got in early at 4.1. But my bad luck stop loss triggered at 12.5 during the free fall. I did not remember setting that at all and to my misery I put stop loss on all shares. Do you think 15 is still a good price to get in?

"I was sold when I saw that they are selling cars all over China. Not some speculative company. They are legit. Now, can they lose it all, sure. Tesla has come close many times before. I put in a pretty penny, I'm just mad I learned about NIO when it hit $11-14. I was a few days late to the 5-6 party. That would have been life changing."
NKLA is more a Titanic than anything.
"You haven‚Äôt missed NKLA, that one is a nothing burger. Just a matter of time since they have a bunch of cash and are only burning $100mil a year."
"Oh..  
Good investigation work though!"
Mind boggled.
It's a line of credit. Though I'd wait for something more official since it looks to just be the word of one person and the rumor mill.
It should be fresh funds aside from the 7 Billion from Hefei municipal
"The 10 billion is 9 million USD once you convert their currency.

Edit: I was way off lol, thank you guys for correcting me, I appreciate it."
"If you're investing relatively long term (holding at least 6 months) then I think yes, for sure. I do think that if it drops below 15 at market open Friday, I will buy some more myself. Think 15 is gonna be a pretty safe floor"
[deleted]
Yeah i assumed it was yuan
"Isn't it $1.4bn?

1$ is 7 RMB"
"Real shit, NKLA will be down by half in probably the next year"
I did a quick Google search so if I messed up on the currency I do apologize on my end haha
"It's all good - just remember this simple conversion and you'll be a-o-kay: 

10bn RMB = 1 tendy"
I was just about to say...there's no way a $9m loan does anything for this company lol

Yes
I'm debating at 14.20
100 dollars in 3 years.
It's very risky at this rate. Apparently it's very popular on Robinhood. Lol
all these few dollar price points would not matter much 1 year down the line... just invest what you can live without

Would be nice. Would be a good deposit for a house based on what I have invested

"I don't think it's a silly question at all. I have a few short answers/ reasons, but if you scour this sub, and look up articles on Google, there's a lot of info about why this company is set up to succeed. Battery swap tech, nio houses, etc..."
"Battery swapping technology. Beijing municipal government alone is going to build 100 battery swapping stations. 

Although  I am not sure whether they will use Nio's technology. I can think of XPeng  and Tesla as its competitors in China. Nio is probably one of the biggest EV startups along with XPeng. 

So that's why I'm bullish long term"
I feel you getting in tomorrow when the market opens up going long run
[deleted]
Literally didn‚Äôt give a single reason for it to drop lol
InvestorPlace so no thoughts at all.
"To me, their reason to believe NIO will likely be less than $10 is invalid because it's not backed up by much. They provide information on why they've been surging for the past few months, but they don't seem to know what's really driving these recent prices. They seem to be worried that the second wave of this pandemic will cause more instability -- but whose second wave? America's? China's? Did stocks really dive because of covid? Not really (well, mines all went up a lot). China went through another wave already. In addition, China has been experiencing horrible flooding due to the excessive rain and their dams on the verge of breaking. Last I read millions have been affected leaving hundreds dead and yet Chinese stocks haven't been impacted.

Edit: grammar!"
"Looking for pullback to 11.50. If it goes below 11. We will see 9.5.

Edit: my own opinion/TA from chart. Also it‚Äôs what I want so I can pickup some more shares for a cheaper price"
"Posted somewhat similar comment but NIO and TSLA both have products they sell. NKLA has no vehicle, and no revenue. It‚Äôs a meme stock"
Not sure why you were downvoted. I think pullback maybe likely too especially if robinhood investors mass sell due to panic.
"Update- Downward pressure continues. Looking at $8 now for support(fill all the gaps). Wednesday sympathy/reaction to TSLA earnings, if they show strong China numbers it could send NiO down(if viewed as competition) or bad numbers could send it up. Other scenario NiO could just move up or down in sympathy with TSLA."
Meah it happens
This yearüòÇ nio will hit 20 in weeks
Heck ppl are saying Tesla can hit 20k a share in 10-15 years. If NIO can get 1/3 of that I‚Äôd be happy :)
The latest unconfirmed news: NIO received 10 billion bank credit„ÄÇ
Nio will hit 25 by the end of December 2020
"No. Short sellers will cause a scare after this rate of growth. I can almost guarantee it, just like IDEX. Just my opinion though."
I almost believe üòÇ
Wouldn't it make NIO market cap close to China GDP?
explains the premarked raise
Uh ok
do you expect this to happen within a week?

No idea
Driven an ES8 / ES6 many times.  Amazing quality of finish. Classy design - nothing overdone or unpleasant. Shockingly quick when you put your foot down.  Impressive phone app interface that is years ahead of traditional manufacturers
"Not driven, but watched and read a ton of more than positive reviews. Key things are fit and finish, build quality, services, and how comfortable the cars are."
Great question. Following.
"https://youtu.be/809QHX_Brus

Clearly a biased take so take that in to account when watching. But the video is comprehensive and useful to give insight on es6 quality"
"I'm interested too. I've driven Tesla before and it's a sick ride. If Nio is on par with it, it's a good investment"
Please be as unbiased as possible.
"Had experience with model s p90d and Es8. Couldn't really compare since the specs are different. Es8, acceleration feels punchy even with its suv weight. Fit and quality is better from my experience"
check the car review i posted in this channel (not me)
Their NIO houses are really cool too
There‚Äôs a scent diffuser that goes below the centre console of the car. I remember watching reviews where buyers have mentioned that they‚Äôve got 3 capsules when they take delivery of the car.
"At this point, I don't doubt that ES6 is much better than model 3."
great video!

Analysts really don‚Äôt understand the Chinese market 1st hand & Chinese numbers are not necessarily transparent. How can you realistically assess the finances behind battery swapping? It may he the smartest idea since the Drive Thru or the dumbest idea since ‚ÄúNew Coke.‚Äù
"My tinfoil hat theory is that I think institutional investors are trying to keep the hype down to build their own positions as crazy as it sounds. Apr and May sales were disclosed during their Q1 earnings call back in May which showed that NIO was on track to put them at an ATH for car sales. Now take a look at the top shareholders...lots of familiar big name companies increasing their positions: [https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=NIO&subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=NIO&subView=institutional)

Rockets and moons!!
That made zero sense
"I bought in on the same day again, prettige winsten!"
I agree this is an unhealthy run up over 100% in less then a month. Its like 60-minutes all over again.
I purchased 1000 @ $2.5.. then today I sold 10 contract for $22 @ 1.5 exp 7/24. So my base is now $1.0. If the contract holds the share hit $22 so we are all happy!
"Haha, zeker weten!"
Its funny that people keep saying this. But dont bat an eye at tesla going from $211 to $1400 in what 4 months lol. Nio is here to stay and there will be corrections but not what people are expecting. This stock is easily worth $100+. All they need is solid deliveries and a factory of thier own.
There it was
That made zero sense
Telsa does have some S&P 500 inclusion hype being priced in at the moment.
"Kohls, Macys, or Dillards bags?"
Yea there is but i keep hearing nio is gonna crash. Meanwhile you got guys paying 4k for super otm calls on tesla. A company that is almost the market cap of walmart. Yet tesla only did 24.6 billion in revenue 2019. Walmart did 515billion. I would worry more about the tesla correction than anything. If tesla can fly high so can nio if done right.
"Good point, I did read some where that short sellers are buying those ridiculous calls to reduce their margin requirements."
Yea maybe but anyone who pays 4k for one contract is crazy as hell or just stupid rich. All i am saying is buy 2021 or 2022 calls sit back relax and watch nio grow.
"Hey bro, I'm very very new too. I think the most important thing to learn first is just money management. ""Pay yourself first"" is a rule I hear a lot, which means if you make $200 (do you have a job btw?), don't invest it all; put aside 50, or whatever you see fit, and invest that.

Basically you don't wanna take a big pile of cash and risk it all. Set stop losses (look it up if you don't know what it is) and just be smart. Don't put yourself in a position to lose a shit tonne of money."

"In that case, either pick two stocks to be safe, or all in on NIO. 300 is a lot for a kid with no job, but if you plan on investing all of it, I think Nio is great. My other recommendation is Coke (KO) because they dipped due to the virus and haven't bounced back yet. Seems like a very reliable stock.

I am, of course, a beginner like you (started in January) so take what I say with a pinch of salt! And good luck"

Definitely gonna but coke at the end of July and thank you for the well wishes
I‚Äôll look into that
Just fell like $2 today i dont know why
"It is currently taking a hit, but I have hope it will get to 20 at the end of the year, not this week."
"I only have 500 shares. 

Im hoping it stays about here for the next 2 months or so.

I like to buy atleast 1000 shares while its under 20 bucks."
"A lot of RH investors likely like you came in on the news this week now it will go down and clear the herd.

Next run up on earnings if they are positive which I think they will be."
It's had a big drop on the growth it was experiencing today. I'm hoping it might drop again to $10-11.50 and then I'll buy in again
"I see. I‚Äôve been in since $9, happy to hold and buy on the dips."
"I think it will stay between 10-13 until more good news come up, more deliveries or acquiring their own factory."
"I have hundreds of options  20210115 $20 call.

I'm not sure it can hit it.I am hesitating whether I should sell all of them."
now $14.56

Too many bulls listening to the bears. It will shoot up.
is the market...it goes up... it goes down .. look at the company vision and execution first... I liked it and bought at average of 5. It was always up and down few dollars...my plan is to hold 5 years and to be customer as soon as they enter in european market. Those cars are special!  And they are now able to grow...once proven profitability stock will naturally fly to the blue sky!
"Kinda did something similar when it went to $12 and then back to the $10.70 range though, still hopeful"
"because of people like OP and post like this. At 90+ on daily RSI, it's going to drop."
would like to find out where our support is as well. it's on everyones radar now though so my guess is $12 for the short/midterm.
Even with close to 600m volume?
Paper hands
aged like milk...
I sure hope so. Why do you reckon it‚Äôs gone down today?
"Because Tesla did. It follows the same trajectory but with higher amplitude.

If Tesla was up and nio down, you may have a problem. 

All is well."
Thanks ü§ôü§ô
"I'll shed some light on this for you. Due to strict capital control in China there are limits on how much money an individual can ""send"" (or simply invest) overseas. As Nio is listed on the NYSE this falls into that category. So what a lot of more wealthy people in China do is open a bank account in Hong Kong. Through this bank account they can access all capital markets more freely. As of right now regular Chinese retail investors have no other way to invest directly into Nio besides through the way I described.

I hope that answers your question. To add more information, a lot of regular Chinese retail investors simply stick to their domestic stock markets such as the Shanghai composite, Shenzhen market etc. This is also why the Shanghai composite lobbied Alibaba to have they secondary listing on there instead of in HK."
"Via brokerages like Webull, Futubull, Tiger Brokers. These relatively new brokerages make it easier for them provided that they already have a bank account in HK or overseas. They are still able to send a certain amount of money overseas though. Chinese ADRs are pretty popular among them. They're called night trader or something. I can't remember the Chinese term.

This is not unique to China as people in my country also will have a hard time investing overseas due to regulation. There isn't any capital control per se, but regulation (or lack of) makes it difficult/expensive to."
"Google is your friend.

The new popularity of NIO is bringing a huge amount of shitposts here.

I'm starting to regret the 1 new post every second day."
"Thera are also brokerages like Webull, Futubull, Tiger Brokers. There are also HK-SZ, HK-SH stock connect. Rich Mainland investors are able to buy Alibaba via stock connect."
"Thank you Jaronn for your response. It was very informative, insightful and explains a lot. I really appreciate it!"
Very informative! Thank you for your response.
"So why don't you go else where then, with all your negativity (I've seen your other posts). I have been on this board long before you."

"Even if true (which I doubt) that's no excuse to shitpost, especially when posting takes longer than you making a search."
">FUTU has been a dream rocketship for me

FUTU is backed by Tencent I believe and they have just turned a profit. The problem with FUTU is although they offer services to Mainlanders, they're technically operating in a grey area."
"What lovely language you have, Oh, and such intelligence and charm... You are probably some frustrated, creepy, jobless 50 year old living in your mother's basement with nothing better to do then troll users on Reddit all day (blocking you weirdo). Good luck and take care!"
NIO is my long term play... don't invest any money you can't afford to lose
Do it. Can see this bad boy hitting 50+
"Do it, I have way more shares than you and I put my life savings into it"
"It is still super risky.

They still have negative margins on their cars.
They project to have 5% positive margin the next period but that is still not much.

It will all depend on their new car rollout and how they handle their costs. It‚Äôs much harder to get proper info on Nio than Tesla for example.

I feel we need to see 10% margins before I would go all in on this stock."
YOLO. In fact I'm waiting for someone to do a WSB Yolo vid on NIO next week.
Thats my thinking.. at the minute I'm on 72 shares. Considering going for 500 and not looking at it for 3-5 years
You are what tempted me hahahah
"Great point and I'll definitely look at this. The more sales they have the more help they will get from the Chinese government,  i think this will drive share price as much as sales but it is still high risk"
Long term yes. But cheer fomo and speculation will drive this thing to 50.
"At 10 percent margins the valuation goes over $50. EVs is a strange market, getting tech valuations instead of automotive sector."
"or you can easily do a weekly buy? that would help you cost average and also give you options from diving all in head first...

maybe 100 shares a week?"
"I would buy some shares though if you plan long term.

But I bought at 4 dollars and sold at 13.3.

Would buy back in at 11-12 range."
Ykno
Its something I thought about but FOMO has a hold of me.. i'll definitely consider that advice
I bought another 50 at 13.38
"Same bought 6.11 sold some at 14 some at 12.50 

Looking to re enter 150 shares at next sub 11 dip"
"Nice nice :) better timing than this morning at least.

I just see NIO being posted everywhere now. As well on WSB. To me that‚Äôs an indicator of lots of fomo and just buying because they see the upwards trend.

I just feel like the recent rise was enough based on the current news. But long term you‚Äôre good."
Be fearful when people are greedy and be greedy when people are fearful
do not panic bro! If it pulls back take advantage of it to buy some more and lower your average price...this stock has always been pretty volatile...however their their products are awesome (check reviews from car owners and swap battery technologies)... they have now passed the most difficult phase...as soon as they will proove the business model making profit I believe the stock will fly way higher... think long term and you will be rewarded :)
my one cent tips&tricks for you in investing: never rush... and never panic.. study the company..once you enter do it slownly so you are able to average the price...and if it double in value...consider to sell half so you will be investing only the profits and take out some emotion if you still believe the model of the company you might be able to buy for cheaper prices...market goes always up..and always down.. if you don't rush you'll be fine! üòú
How you feeling ? If it‚Äôs shares hold your fine.
Don‚Äôt panic. Being emotionally detached seems to be a pretty big factor in succeeding with investments.
Don't check your nio stock price every day?

"you bought in super high but the absolute worst thing you can do is panic sell on any kind of dip.  I think you need to come up with a plan to DCA downwards on corrections and play the long game. keep monitoring the income statements, balance sheets, and quarterly/annual reports for this company so that you're not completely in the dark.

If you believe in it like you say you do, then you shouldn't be worried about the prices. just revisit this stock in 1-5 years. I got in at a super cheap price but i haven't been afraid to purchase as it increases. Right now their revenue shows great growth. 10.3 cars sold in Q2 means that they made about 500M USD for the qtr. their costs are something to closely monitor but the CEO has said it from the very beginning - their goal is to be profitable sooner than later."
Lmao. Jinxed it
"Also, Tesla needs market competition. Think Amazon & Alibaba, Apple & Samsung, Walmart & Target, etc"
"Thanks for the input. I have seen the stock and product reviews on YouTube, seemed very positive. Not very clear on how to analyse the company on paper. I am holding it for long term too. Will likely buy more if it drops below $10."
How many shares do you have? And what is your average?
"Must stay strong, average for my shares is 12.50 and those dips sucked"
I should probably take this up
"Bought 210 shares this morning @ around 13.84. It hurts, it stings actually. But long terrrrrrrrrm"
True I guess!
In it for long
"Story of my life!

Anyway, I have put a stop loss sell order on it. if it dips at any point, I will probably buy more. It's very volatile atm and I am sure it will dip and get back up soon."
"Also, the number you mentioned is without their compact cars. Q3 and Q4 will have number from three models including the smaller one. I am hoping it will go up as the year goes."
Started tanking right when posted lol
"exactly ... Google & Yahoo... Coca Cola & Pepsi... McDonald & Burger King üôÇ 
I see TSLA leading EV and Energy market in the next decade.
On the other hand NIO is the best competitor I found so far...and the battery swapping technology, base price, virtual assistant Nomi, premium interior ( massage includedüòç), convertible roof, autopilot...in short an attractive car I want to own in the near future! Plus no-factory strategy ...I believe their product can currently compete in the EV market much more than many (combustion engine) car manufacturer trying to convert to EV... in fact I believe NIO will start licencing their technologies to them (check nio and volkswagen)...and this will make it grow at unpredictable levels and rate. Apple was the personal computer manufacturer. Microsoft was licencing the software to IBM and others. They both won. But it would be interesting to rewiew the history of them. They shaped the current economy."
I consistently kept NIO the 25% of my portfolio averaging a price of 5 dollars.  I've let it run yesterday till 11 before selling half and basically holding long term the profits... will buy back consistently keeping it 25% of my portfolio. 50% is in tsla and the rest 25% in spce. I usually buy and sell once every other week...unless receiving some unusual jump up or down (down is for me an occasion to buy more...up is an occasion to balance the portfolio)
How many you got ?
Be patient mate
550 so I lost the 1k gains I saw lol
500 here. I am thinking of getting another 500 if it tanks below 10$.
"If it drops below 10, I'm just gonna have to hold for a while since that is quite a loss. Hoping for a small rally into 13 tomorrow"
Pump tomorrow at opening then a slow small decline
What should i do w my call expiring 7/31. Think it will be steady 13-15 or possibly hit 20+ by end of month?
"There‚Äôs another hour left in the day. It‚Äôll probably pump back up before close , just not to $15."
Merely a decline in growth or a proper drop like today?
Yup you called it
Bro go do some research.
No he didn't (well not the first part). It dropped down to $12.88
How does one do research? Asking for friend
Excuse me? I'm just asking to clarify your ambiguous statement.
Meh it's back up after hours. If you're in this for the long run don't fret these small swings...
Yup you called it
"It triggered my trailing stopper at 12.53

Been in since 6.11

Im quite mad

This is the first time this has ever happened so what should i do to stay involved just rebuy in?"
i heard there are over 300 EV makers in China... most of them either failed or will fail
Undervalued.
"I agree , but asking this sub about NIO is like asking a real estate agent if it‚Äôs a good time to buy a house."
True but that‚Äôs why you have to do your DD. I‚Äôve done mine and am very confident in the company. Bubble or not this is a solid company to invest in
Agree I bought again today at 14.  Not at all sad because my average cost is around 6 USD and I think eventually (barring outright criminal management) the market cap should be at least 10 percent of TSLA
To the moon we go!

"There isn't enough news for that, we barely have a daily post in here.

Edit: if a daily discussion can reduce the amount of shitposts about speculation, I'm in."
 Can someone give an analysis around the price movement right now?
Got in at $3.40 last year. We‚Äôre holding boys.
Seams a huge jump on  small factory acquisition news... though could mean they are a more serious bet if they are making there own cars?
ËîöÊù•ÁâõÈÄºÔºÅ
Have 4 sharesüòâ
How many shares do you guys have?
"2700 at 7.58 then my dumbass sold at 11.75 cuz I got scared of the volatility. Stock mooned to 13.20 shortly thereafter. 

Real news comes at mid-early August. So all this is price volatility. I‚Äôm still salty"
Feel free to join the chat room! I will be exploring new ways to interact and grow with the community. Feel free to post your suggestions for the subreddit.
"This will race past $20 and beyond, faster than we know.  Look at Tesla or square as an example.

I wouldn't bet against NIO right now, there are lots of good things about to happen, starting with their quarterly call, they may announce about a factory of their own, EC6 is another one.  

In next 1 week there may be a short pull back but I wouldn't count on it because we really cannot predict if that's going to happen or not."
Today: STONKS
i'm in
Is having such a high volume over 400 million a bad thing? Most companies are way under a 100M.
"those who bought nio don't want to sell...it's gonna hold for a atleast two weeks...unless short attacks ..
crossing $14 it may break out"
Anyone have dilution concerns?
Please
If it is a fraction of Tesla then we are going to be at $50 a share.
to the moon...
[deleted]
It's going up but be careful for a big drop.
I got in at 1.50 :) let‚Äôs fucking go!
There is going to be a huge correction soon IV is through the roof and movement is not on the same level. Bought @6 sold @13.40
Â§©ÁéãÁõñÂú∞ËôéÔºÅ
lol
10000 and I will buy more this week
60000 shares at 3.19 average. In a state of manic psychosis I got an intuition Nio was the one. Haha. So far so good.
"Only 900 @2.68, it was my first investment, this and the Sirius minerals buy out have made me good money (relative to my invested funds) about 300% return"
A petty 22 (plus some fractional amount. About 80% of a share of the top of my head). I'm hoping to bump the figure closer to a hundred. I can't be putting in huge amounts sadly
"Around 6000 now. Initial average price @ 2.4, bought more and more as the price went up."
600 plus a few Calls. I‚Äôm only adding. It can go up and I‚Äôll buy. It can go down and I‚Äôll buy. 50-200 shares a week for a while is what I‚Äôll be adding.
"3,000 at 11.90 (bought today)"
Got a lot of attention in the last couple of days. Those that don't really believe in or understand Nio will take a small profit and go.
IM NOT FUCKING SELLING!
We hit it hours ago. We‚Äôll be hitting 18 tmrw
"Them securing funding to keep the lights on for a few years, ramping sales during covid, and increasing production capabilities is going to increase the pps.

This is a different nio than last week"
"Big drop coming sooner or later, I‚Äôd guess later but I‚Äôm confident it‚Äôll rise up again, no matter what. If Nikola can raise 20$billion without producing any actual vehicles, I‚Äôd say the potential is real for NIO. It might seem crazy because it has risen so fast but in my opinion, it‚Äôs just catching up where it should be."
"Fuck man that must be the lowest it ever went, or close. I have a few dozen at 2.50, then about 200 between 4 and 7. Holding hard, and gonna buy a handful more every few days"
Can see a correction on the cards soon. Though I'm in Nio for the long haul. Huge potential for these guys I think.
‰∏ÄÁôæÂÖ´‰∏ÄÊùØÔºÅ
[deleted]
75% of them will buy back in higher
"No, I‚Äôm actually really interested in NIO. Especially the fact that you can replace the battery on their vehicles. Just want to know more before investing like any other person."
Really? The growth has taken somewhat of a decline today
"China pretty much got COVID under control.

Don't really see Nio tanking unless the market tanks."
"I assumed that we are talking short term here. 

If you want to hold for years, a few $ in your buying price won't matter when the stock is at 100 or 200$ because I do think it will get there on 2 years max."
It's nowhere near where it should. It should be much higher like 50-75$ but it's a Chinese company and Wall Street is racist to put it simply even more lately than before.
Anyone else see it try to dump under 13 dollars in the last 10 mins and pop back up. I‚Äôd say this thing is still bullish even if it does dump in the next week
"Yeah, that's right."
"yeah, I'd like to know what makes him think that."
"Yeah, short term.

They have a lot of institutional money holding them and tencent owns a good amount.

Im expecting a pullback at some point but i don‚Äôt think itll dip as far as some would think"
"Racist?  You are the type to call everyone racist.  

&#x200B;

You're the problem"
"I agree, it is not a blue chip company, I never buy those, because the chance of success is really low. I buy companies that already make a lot of money, even if they make less than they earn (high growth companies)."
I think they must have posted it just before the dip came
"My guess is as far down as 7.5$ with a stabilisation around 9$ because I like my fibs very much. 

What's yours?"
"Your lack of understanding of ""to put it simply"" is impressive."
yeah. probably.
"Between yesterday and today, we had a clear volume price breakout. Id be surprised to see it dip below $9 during normal times but with covid jitters and its impact on global economy...who knows"
You are the type of person that has to bring race into a stock forum.  Go read white fragility to someone that cares.
"We took the same dollar value gain today as 2 days ago (about 1.5-1.6$) with twice the volume.

NIO has made the news big time and a lot of new players have entered usually not a good sign."
"Damn, you're further lost than I thought enjoy your life in your bubble, mate!

Calling you a moron would be a compliment."
"Hence the possible sideways action. Youll see new guys who are not long take their gains and replaced with longs.

The funding they secured removes doubts of bankruptcy for the next 1-2 years, thats what drove the price down initially.

Now they have ramping sales into the face of a covid downturn market.

Definitely some hype built into this but we crossed over the ipo price after years of being in the red but also remember that this is a different company since the ipo pricing..."
Mate?  Oh British socialist... now i get it
"How insecure are you with your opinions to feel the need to pick fights on internet like this?

I'll be happy to read you if it can help you be a better person."
"I'm not the youtuber but I believe his analysis is quite good and I took some of his analysis as the basis of my thesis on Nio.

I do have a blog post on Nio. 

 [https://mybornean.blogspot.com/2020/06/creating-my-own-arkk-innovation-etf-1.html](https://mybornean.blogspot.com/2020/06/creating-my-own-arkk-innovation-etf-1.html)"
selling is out of the question imo
"Congrats man. Tbh idk whether or not to sell, or to keep holding and buy more. What do you think about its long term potential?"
That mug is money!!
Pretty frustrated I didn‚Äôt place a market order at end of day Friday. Put in an order at 10.50 this morning (not filled)and now I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôll ever hit 10 again.
"I will wait until it reaches $100. :) Chinese government wants to reduce pollution. They invest NIO too. They need EV. Meanwhile, Chinese are getting richer and richer now, more and more people will buy NIO cars."
"NIO has a market cap of 11 billion.

TSLA has a market cap of 220 billion.

Hold and ride it"
Stop loss and buy back in ?
Got it last year from the NIO store in China.
It might but it‚Äôll hit triple digits in the long run so it‚Äôs negligible what you‚Äôre contemplating rn
"TSLA is not just a car company though. They make solar panels, invent and manufacture batteries for grid storage, make and install solar panels, and write software for autonomous driving. Nio pays other companies to make their batteries, even their cars (for now).

Don‚Äôt misunderstand me - I am long on NIO too, but you cannot compare them to TSLA as if it‚Äôs an apples to apples comparison."
I wouldn‚Äôt do a stop loss. Just bite the bullet for the long run and you‚Äôll reap the rewards
"I tend to agree. Knew movement was coming with all the press coming in now. 20% days aren‚Äôt normal hoping it holds for another week or so I can throw more in. I originally got in at 2.67 and again at 5.60 so I guess I‚Äôm just buying every time it doubles now. I do think it‚Äôll hit 20-25 this year but didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd happen this  month, not sure now."
Listen to this guy.
"Those are all valid points.

What do you think would be an realistic future market cap for NIO?"
Any reasons why? Noob here so I set a stop loss at 10 dollars. Got in at 5.  If it triggers the stop loss I would try to get back in with all profits at a lower price. Does this not make sense to do ?
"This is a very volatile stock that could shoot up at any day. If you try to time the pull back and put a stop loss at 10, let‚Äôs say it hits 10 tmrw at 10AM and you sell off your stock. There‚Äôs a chance it could shoot back up to 13 the same day and it wouldn‚Äôt go much lower than that. There‚Äôs no guarantee the stock goes below your stop price. The higher the stock goes, the higher the pull back floor is. If you‚Äôre aiming to buy back in at around 9, it may not even hit that point and you lost your gains. It‚Äôs best not to try to time it. The point is it will definitely grow long term"
Very good point. Thank you I‚Äôll take this into account.
"Agree with what you've written up. There should be a discount at the moment as Chinese stocks don't have a good reputation. However if NIO is the first one to actually buck that trend, and eventually people realise the accounting is legit, then people will be very quick to reprice it higher. Not a slow grind up, but literally one day $12 a share and the next day wake up to $20+ a share. Then a trend from then on reaching $100+ over a few years. Seen repricing events happen with many stocks."
"NIO is independently audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian, which can be read here: https://ir.nio.com/resources/investor-faqs#:~:text=NIO%20Inc.'s%20independent%20auditor%20is%20PricewaterhouseCoopers%20Zhong%20Tian%20LLP.

Luckin coffee had interestingly the same auditor as WireCard, an auditor called Ernst & Young--it was under Ernst & Young that the fraudulence happened; NOT under the auditor of NIO (PWC Zhong Tian), who has a ""flawless record"" as stated by Adam Gefvert.

Who else does Ernst & Young audit you might ask? Hewlett Packard; Verizon; State Street; AT&T; Coca Cola; General Motors; Hilton; Lockheed Martin; 21st Century Fox; The Carlyle Group--the list goes on.

So to recap: NIO is audited by an independent auditor deemed ""flawless"" and is NOT the same auditor that audited LK, or WireCard for that matter.

This is easily a three digit stock!"
Nice to see a quality post. Thankyou
I like your way of thinking.  I‚Äôm holding....
"Fascinating video. I am guessing that Nio will soon invest in having its own factory, probably in Hefei. If the growth of Nio continues and it probably will, they will be production limited very soon. I believe the max production of the current factory is around 4.5k cars a month?"
Hey shit that was awesome!
When can I buy one?
Nvm switched to browser and I can. This is excellent
Holly shit. That was awesome to watch!!
"I wonder when they‚Äôll break into the market in America.

Edit:  after reading this:
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/01/16/next-china-trade-battle-could-be-over-electric-cars/ 
I think the answer is: when they can produce cars and batteries that meet European and American standards.  Not just safety standards but also quality standards.  Tesla has done well to set the bar pretty high, or at least clear an already high bar.  
The article says the company produces 20000 cars, and had 4800 battery recalls.  But they do so battery swaps, so that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean ~1/4 of thier cars were recalled., but it still seems like a lot of recalls .  
That said I don‚Äôt see nio being the next Tesla.  It might take a while for nio to meet higher standards, they may not want or need to!  Maybe gm needs to buy thier plants and try to fix thier reliability issues.  I am less hopeful the stock will blow up like Tesla did, because they are not as solid a company as Tesla... but that‚Äôs just from what the news said.
I hope Tesla dominates the market over there."
Depends where you live
I can
Like 3k delivered to actual customers.. over 10k for Q2.
it means they delivered 3k cars I believe. Nothing to do with orders. Plenty of reviews available if you can speak Mandarin.

As for what kind of customers.... to my eye nio has done a great job with styling and establishing a cohesive design language that speaks to an above average consumer.  It looks like at least a credible alternative to the nicer EVs out there, and very competitive visually with ice options. If the JD power us and China surveys are accurate wrt Tesla and nio, they very well may have a very high quality product, so I don't know if they'll have an unusually difficult time gaining customers.  I'd for sure test drive one if available in the US."
Unlikely without a service infrastructure
"even without battery swapping infrastructure Nio still build great cars. This is literally the most fundamental thing for Nio, GREAT cars. No fast charging could be a problem, but if EVs are going to take over I'd imagine a universal fast-charging network appearing someday."
"Fast charging is part of the NIO product, but the battery swap is really a concession to how people live in China.  Unlike the US, pretty much everyone lives in big highrises, which may or may not have fast charging infrastructure, and public supercharger infrastructure is hit or miss, so the battery swaps add an extra layer of protection to the problem of not being able to access a charger.  If you haven't been to big cities in China....it's rather overwhelming to see, and completely unlike anything you'll see in the US outside of maybe the very densest parts of NYC (except for whatever is left of the Hutongs in Beijing, and the French Concession in Shanghai, which are relatively low density districts, but still pretty dense).  It's hard to really communicate the scale of what I'm talking about if you haven't seen it first hand."
Yes.. I have Jan 2021 15c and 20c & Jan 2022 $10C. Bought a few weeks ago.. so they are cooking in the oven
"Held 80 of Jan 2021 10$ calls since March from average price of 0.3. Dumped 60 of them on Thursday into close at avg 2.8. Way too much premium in those and pullback & consolidation is really likely which would suck most of the premium out of them. Still almost a 10x so I‚Äôm happy with that. Looking to reenter once this NIO calms down a bit for few months.

Edit:
If I were you then I would instead just buy equity. Calls are really hot right now and not worth the price imo."
Can you explain like I‚Äôm 5 what an option is ?
"I sold my $5 2022 calls, had a ton of them and my plan was to hold for a good year. Seriously had some weird I don't want to lose this money panic day while being up and went against my plan. I knew for sure this would keep running and at this point I don't even want to watch this stock anymore because it's pissing me off I sold."
"Great point. But given that this is poised to be in the 30s or even more, would the returns still be better than equity investment? Definitely not 10x but may be 5x for long term/Jan 2022?"
"It's a contract to let you buy shares of a stock at a certain price by a certain date. If the expiration date arrives and your contractual price is less than what the market price is for the shares, you win. If the expiration date arrives and your contractual price is more than the market price for that stock, you lose."
so buy more. 2022 is a long way off and these first few dollars are nothing in the scheme of things.
"It‚Äôs really possible for NIO to reach 30 of course, but when buying options you definitely want to buy when nobody else is buying aka after some decent consolidation or a nice pullback. You‚Äôre gonna get it so much cheaper. Returns are obviously gonna be much much better than with equity, but you really want to focus on the entry and not buy when retail money is buying like right now. Just be patient and try to remember to buy when NIO suddenly gets some bad news and starts to look bad. If you‚Äôre afraid that NIO is gonna run straight to 30 from this point then you can always buy equity just in case it does, but it probably won‚Äôt."
Explain like I‚Äôm full retard?
"I bought calls yesterday to hold for a day or two, it looked like a mistake in the morning but ended up cashing out nicely later in the day. I feel likes it has ran way to fast and hard to get back in for now."
Makes total sense. Thanks!
"I paid a broker $100 for a contract to buy 100 shares of NIO for $10 each. That expires January 21st, 2022. If January 21st, 2022 arrives and the market price of Nio shares is $30, I invoke my contract and can do one of two things - buy 100 shares of NIO for $10 each (costing me $1000) and hold on to them, or I can buy the hundred shares for $10 each ($1000 total) and instantly sell them back into the market for $3,000, putting $2,000 instantly into my pocket.

If January 21st, 2022 arrives and Nio is worth less than $11 ($10/share + the $1 per share I paid for the contract), the contract is worthless as I could effectively buy $1,000 worth of NIO shares on the open market instead."
So you then lose money for the failed contract?
Yes. All of it.
Interesting
It will be worthless below 10 and not 11 right? 11 is break even? Just want to make sure I am not misunderstanding something
"11 or under. Remember, I paid $1 per share for the $10 contract, meaning in order to break even the shares need to be worth at least $11 on the market to break even."
Dude. That's nuts. Are you gonna hold on to your shares or sell? I would keep sell some and diversify in case NIO tanks like LK did.
"Congrats :) you and I are in the same boat ! I went in 100% last year and never stopped believing in NIO, it was tough but it turned out good.  I would like to hold till at least $25 before pulling out."
wallstreetbets!!!
" Personally I would secure the initial investment of 40,000 and let the rest run. Should be a good week with a lot more people starting to invest in NIO, well done!"
Tip of the iceberg
Pre market looking hot asf
Congrats! Shares or options?
"Dude did the same thing when it was 2.42 a share

What a rollercoaster!

But seriously I‚Äôm holding for when these cars finally hit the US market!  I will sell the shares then to pickup a car for sure"
At least pull your original investment out and ride the free wave
You shouldn't have listened to me. Are you still holding all your shares?
Yeah I‚Äôm praying these calls don‚Äôt drag me under water. Not selling my shares until $40 minimum
"Well done, bruh."
"Good man. I got it and out many times. More calls than I can count. Then, one day, a friend text me about ‚Äòthat stock you always talked about has gone way up‚Äô..."
"Where did you buy the shares? 

I'm buying mine via freetrade"
[deleted]
Thanks man. It feels surreal. I've been invested in nio for a long time now. Im going to hold though. In it for the long run
"Do not sell, you will regret"
even $25 is too early
"What's making this such a hot company (not stock). Anything unique? Besides their Chinese backing. Which, would make it a strong buy, but we have seen that fail before."
Thanks man! Shares
"Yeah man, its up at $240,000 now xD I'm honestly shocked. I wake up every morning expecting it to go down, but its been going up 3 days in a row."
"Haha sadly, I pulled out, mate. Ended with $200,000, but I'm regretting it now haha"
Idk I would maybe wait until it looks like we start to see another pullback and take a portion out and either put it in index funds or hold it in a money market and wait for the next market crash. You never want all your eggs in one basket bro
NIO millionaire in a few months... congrats!
I‚Äôm with you brother. I‚Äôm in deep for the long run
"Yes I agree, I won't be touching it until 100 atleast.  Learned from my mistake with Tesla, sold toooooo early !

I think this will move faster to triple digits than we imagine"
"It's an electric vehicle company, nothing else to say really. Just posted positive growth and delivers from Q2 despite Covid! do your own DD"
What are your plans for it man? This is like a dream come true. Long term hold?
[deleted]
You can‚Äôt fucking time the pullback
Get out of here with that speculative suggestion. It‚Äôs a booming company with a relatively  small market cap that is going to grow in the largest EV market In the world.
bailey gifford (largest shareholder of tesla) thinks its worth $300 ;)
"I bought Tesla at $33 and sold at $300. Of course hindsight says I should have stayed in, but I'm happy with what I got from it.

NIO I bought for an average of like $2.80 each, most of them at the $1.50 mark. So I figure I hold until at least $100 if that ever comes."
"I know its guaranteed to hit $20 within a year. I might sell it when it hits $20 and buy a house somewhere remote, work on starting my own business, and keep investing in other stuff. God willing"
Thanks man üòä
"Yeah it may do well but it may not. It's a Chinese company. Look what happened to LK. He made a bet, it paid off. Now is time to take some profit and reinvest elsewhere to diversify. It's completely retarded to keep your life savings in one stock. No matter how good this company is going to do, it will see a significant pullback if the overall market crashes."
"Yep and I agree with them 100% - now we just have to wait patiently and not touch NIO at all.

I'm distracting myself with other stocks and analysis - right now I just entered long into SHLL and also DDing on SPAQ.

Good luck to us :)"
Smart man
Congrats dude seriously. This has and continues to be my dream to wake up to something like this. Wishing you more success
"LK is not Nio horrible comparison, with the only thing comparable that they‚Äôre from China. Beijing‚Äôs and China‚Äôs economy is not the US economy and regardless of pullback EV market is way undervalued. Current combustible vehicle drivers will all convert by law in the foreseeable future."
Thanks man seriously. I made so many business mistakes in my life. Got cheated by a business partner so i had to declare bankrupticy. Lost thousands of dollars. I thank God finally something good happened with my investments. Best wishes to you bro. I wish better fortune for you than myself
Not disagreeing with you but if i were op I would take out the initial investment which looks like 50 grand and do what I said. That's still leaving 100 grand in nio
"I‚Äôm a bit leery of it going above $16, to be honest, but I am an abject novice. Why is $20 the magical number?"
"Fair enough, a bit of risk management."
"I agree, I've also looked at Nio like Chinese smartphones."
It‚Äôs not any cheaper than other electric cars is it like Tesla?
"Wouldn't mind a Tesla-esque rise to $1000, but that's probably just a bit optimistic"
Why is moon not an option?
Wall street.
"I see a maximum possibility of hitting half of whatever TSLA market cap at the time is, assuming equal production and margins.  I see TSLA cooling off to back around $900 PPS, which i think would maybe mean a top case around $90 PPS for nio?  Just estimating without figures and calculator.  But realistically, I think more likely $40 to $50, which would still be pretty awesome."
We are all wishing for that üòé
[deleted]
[deleted]
Didn't have enough options :(
"Frankly, I still don't understand the massive hype over Tesla. I understand that it's more than a car company in the form of being able to roll out its own supercharger network but I struggle to see how the company is already more valuable than Toyota.

Conversely, NIO has taken a similar approach whereby there's extensive customer support in the form of battery swap stations and NIO houses but I wouldn't say I think this company will be $200 after considering the amount of shares out there"
Can still wish on a dream though. üòÉüòÉ
"As a n investor, sure id like to see my shares appreciate. But NOT through buy backs. I want them to innovate. Don‚Äôt waste capital on us (shareholders), don‚Äôt be like the airlines"
Honestly dunno how crazy the market will be and how crazy people will be on Nio. But $10 is just the beginning for Nio in the long term so no real worries.
It doesn‚Äôt matter. Just hold
"NIO is a young company that has real growth and the numbers/ results are showing. Continued results will bring pumpers and talking heads but when you speak of a bubble, that will be a long time from now (for NIO). Don‚Äôt confuse the current volatility in the stock price with some type of bubble. It is interesting when you go back in history and read about when other new technologies emerged you will find the similar scenario that we are in now for EV‚Äôs (Airplanes, radios, tv, internet, etc). Many players enter the market but only the quality ones prosper. Good luck and good vibes!"
+19-20%... It has already started. The question is: where and when will it stop? WSB could take it to 50$ and it wouldn't be overvalued considering their potential and execution so far.
Workhorse was like a $7 stock but jumped up to $20 in only a few days. The highest I've seen Nio was around the $10 range and if it can break the $10 resistance level it can also shoot to the moon in a few days.
"Thanks to you, I bought 3k shares just now at 11.90 and it's already offset my losses for the day. I wish I had bought more! Thank you!"
What do yall think? I call it pure BS but whatever.
"Oh Shit WSB is on to our company NIO where, a huge pump and dump in the coming week(s)."
"Post had 5,000+ upvotes, 800 comments so far. 
You best believe NIO @ 10$ on Monday some of these ''ballers'' will definitely be putting in big orders.!!"
Huge pump coming üòã
"I don‚Äôt understand the guy who wrote its point .  For one NIO makes their own stuff (currently). Which is rated better than Tesla by other companies / countries.   They won best EV in Germany over Tesla .... why would they steal ‚Äúinferior‚Äù ideas/ tech?   

Secondly .... yes Chinese companies have been known to steal .   However this idea is not just done by China,  many companies do this including US ones."
"Frankly, even if it were true that there might be illegal information transfer, there are much bigger manufacturers in China such as BYD instead of NIO. I just don‚Äôt see how it would reach NIO considering BYD moves much more vehicles than NIO"
sort of reminds me of the 80's when the first apple computer came out.  six months later a chineese company was offering a similar computer called the banana.
"Its bs sensationalism, China likes Tesla bc they provide jobs for Chinese engineers and designers, etc. 

Given that China bent over backwards for Tesla and even allowed Tesla to file lawsuits in the country is enough evidence to show China has no intentions of taking of the gigafactory anytime soon.

Plus NIO is making their own factory."
"My thoughts exactly. Shame all my shares will be called away at $7 this weekend, I'll have to rebuy on monday. I wasn't expecting a huge run up this week, and June sales release."
Nailed it. What do you think happens to the stock from here? Back down or does it stay solid?
exactly.
">sort of reminds me of the 80's when the first apple computer came out.  six months later a chineese company was offering a similar computer called the banana.

The same Chinese company probably doesn't want to be called ""Chinese"" now."
any source on Nio building their own factory?
"Sideways until earnings report, I think it's around September. Then it might go up when the EC6 comes out in September. But this is a long term hold. They have a lot of room to grow."

Thanks a bunch. I'm adding this to my blog.
1 yr projection is ~$36

Serious question. This scares me to think about it. Will the bubble burst?
I dont see $300 anytime soon.. but could be 80 by end of year IMO.. will see what July brings with product announcements and financials.
"I have about $35 worth right now. Should I buy some more now? I‚Äôm not sure because I can‚Äôt tell if this is the lowest it‚Äôll be, or if it will drop again sometime."
i got in 53@2.58 but cashed out @ 5 :(
You truly feel that's possible? Don't they have like 1 billion outstanding shares.
"Long Term, buy buy buy, Hold Hold Hold.  You'll be thankful in 10 years when this is the jewel of your portfolio and you got in at ground level."

"If you have money you dont use, and are not afraid of losing it for a couple of years, then you should invest. But dont look at the stock price every day. Because it will go low, but it can also go very high in a few years. Think loong therm."
Definitely buy if it dips again. Or now if you have money to throw at it.
It‚Äôs still a good trade
Baller Status.
">NIO delivered 10,331 vehicles in the three months ended June 2020, exceeding quarterly guidance  
>  
>NIO delivered 3,740 vehicles in June 2020 setting a new monthly record  
>  
>Cumulative deliveries of ES8 and ES6 reached 46,082

Better than my expectation from my previous post here."
I assume this was the reason for the massive shift in the share price today. I wish I'd bought more shares. I bought them at an average of 7.36 dollars.
Nio has never been in a better shape. Good stuff happening. I think Nio's sales will continue increasing.
Good to hear! What do you see the price target moving forward? I feel like it could very well go above $10 soon.
Yes they are really the chinese Tesla and this quarter is the first confirming it. They come back from near death.
"Premarket is already at 8.40 which means the 0.236 fib from the down trend is going to be broken, not much resistance until what I consider the real ATH at 10.64$ and after that the sky is the limit."
"If you believe that it will increase, then you should. I do believe it will reach triple digits in years time"
I wouldn‚Äôt say chinese Tesla but they are definitely in the same conversation
Feels damn good to be sitting on a handful of Jan/2022 $10 calls I picked up in February on the cheap.
Do you think I should get additional shares or just wait until it drops again? My avg cost is $7.31.
"Yeah I'm going to add more. In the grand scheme of things after a few years, the concept of buying at $8 vs $9 may seem insignificant to me."
"I bought then sold, my bad. Thinking to make another big entry but the trade politics between US China is a concern."
"If you really dive into Nio's product, it is better than Tesla in many ways. That's the core of the business, the cars and the services they provide."
Same here. Bought $8 calls babyyy
In for $10 calls! And a ton of Jan 2021 very cheap!
"Do you think Nio will be doing considerably more deliveries five years from now? I sure do. NIO is a 5-10 year stock, just like TSLA. Dollar cost average every opportunity you get and don't care about timing the price."
"That's your call to make, sorry but I'm not a financial advisor just sharing my opinion."
It will drop again. I would expect to buy around $7
"Good call, king"
"If they don't get delisted, then yes. Even current TSLA price will look cheap in couple of years."
"Time will tell, they need to start selling outside China to be a real competitor but China alone can take them to 100B market cap or more."
[deleted]
Have you or do you know someone who bought NIO?
I agree with you!
Fosho thanks tho
"I think we‚Äôre past that tbh. If it will drop I think it will bottom at 8, but I think we will definitely break 10 before that"
Ramping sales makes this a different beast. Wouldnt hold my breath for $7 unless the overall market crashes
Fair point! I agree on the last statement.
Then buy small amounts in regular intervals.
"Ya, don't see a big correction unless it's the market. Nio will be better and better, especially in the next couple of months."
Umm... there's no video
3h and still no video...
[deleted]
What‚Äôs the point of this group if not to post updates/ promote discussion about NIO?
Bought 200 more... this is a long hold stock for me.
Gunna see where its at EOD. Seems like a red day all round!
Buy
Hooooold
I havnt seen a shade green today in general
Managed to get in a few more positions at $6.70 :)
"Bought more, hoping it goes down to 6 so i can buy even more. This will rocket with earnings in september. Sales are crazy in china right now and EC6 hit production."
The drop didn't go back into my channel so it's a nice discount so far before ATH.
Next mths will be decline mode
I bet you're happy this morning that you bought some more shares
$FUV is a happy little guy nonetheless.
"Haha haven't even noticed until your comment, so thank you!"
Fantastic looking car
It‚Äôs gonna blowup
Lmao.  Hard pass.
Yikes
"Thanks for the bearish take, it was thought provoking"
Of course!
"I am not a financial advisor. 

I shared that on another post and figure that it could be of interest to other.

 NIO delivered 3,155 vehicles in April 2020 &  3,436 vehicles in May 2020 making 6,591 in total. If June is at 3.2k deliveries, they will be well over 9k deliveries for the quarter.

It would be their record quarter and about a 3 times improvement YoY and QoQ.

u/DanHassler0 can delete if you think that it's not appropriate, just let me know the reason please."
"Wow that's awesome, thanks !!!"
Sell when you want to but you‚Äôll regret it :)
The Chinese government bailed them out. If that doesn't tell you the length the Chinese government will go to have a government owned electric car  idk what to tell you. I think they will eventually become just as big as Tesla and spread all across Asian and more.
Timing? You never know. I‚Äôm investing in Nio for long term gain. Sort of like investing Tesla in early times.
I have been buying in segments (I buy more every few weeks) and today I brought more at 7.25. I know that sounds high (I mistakenly  bought way to early in the day) but I am in this for the long term so it does not matter... My personal belief is that NIO stock will be somewhere in the range of $50 min to $100 max per share within the next 52 weeks. I am very bullish on this stock long term.... Just my opinion though.
"I'm not in on this stock anymore (which is one of my mistakes lately) but it just broke out of the channel I drew a while back (around January 22nd peak) and based on the fib I drew when it dropped in October (all time low) it's right there at 0.382.

I would be optimistic that it can go back to ATH with another delivery numbers for June making it a great Q2 and the heavy demand lately for a second Tesla but a real one, not that scam that is Nikola. 

I consider NIO as the only serious competitor to Tesla.
Looking at it now, I actually should re-enter.

EDIT: link to publish idea on tradingview: https://in.tradingview.com/chart/NIO/yO9kWHGd-NIO-on-the-road-to-a-new-ATH/"
Still doubting? üòÅ
You already made some money and your question is answered.
For me anything under $10 dollars is a buy - Long term play
I don‚Äôt think it will ever hit $8.  Sorry
Not entirely true about the Chinese government bailed them out. It is the Hefei local government's investment in NIO. Though China does support EV overall and NIO especially.
Define long...
"I sell at 7.20, I'm using 1-10 leverage so I have ""big"" gains"
What makes you think that?
Like not going to sell until I need it
It‚Äôs his opinion man
"The chart, I think it will hit $8 maybe intraday but never hold.  I‚Äôm not a pro. I did own it from $4 to $8 and back down to $5 and I didn‚Äôt make a lot of money.  I held too long."
Can anybody give a dumbed down version of what this means?
tl;dr
"So basically NIO is offering to sell more percentage of their company to the public through shares in order to raise the funds necessary to continue their strategic growth. Lets hypothetically say they had 1 million shares available to the public before hand that made up 20% of the total company, and now they are offering another 1 million shares bringing the total ownership of NIO in the public to 40%. This gives up some of their ownership, but raised them a substantial amount of capital so that they can use the money to invest in the growth of their company. Ideally, the growth will make their 60% ownership worth more than their 80% ownership prior if their strategic investments play out as they plan. They are currently taking advantage of the obvious interest in their company to offer shares at a price that is adventageous to them ($5.95) in hopes that the interested public will see that this price is still a good value and will buy up the shares and give NIO the capital they need for their investment plans. TESLA did this exact maneuver in Febuary. They took advantage of their increased interest and decided to offer shares at a price that was currently valued at a reasonable price to the public which in turn played out adventageous for both the buying (public) and selling (tesla) parties. When more shares are offered to the public WITHOUT significant current interest in the company, this kind of offering can lead to share price decline due to dilution. However, a company where investors can see a bright future and a good investment via financial reports, ect. can offer these shares in a time of growth and benefit without the dilution effecting price TOO much due to the counterbalance of the offering price still being a good long term current price value investment for the public. Hope this helps a bit!"
"Thank you I appreciate it! Are those shares in the offering only available to shareholders? I don‚Äôt technically have any shares at the moment but I do own a few call options so would those count and if so, how would I go about purchases shares at the offering price?"
So when does this new price take effect? How do you acquire shares with the new price ? Cause it doesn‚Äôt seem close to 5.90. How does this work?

It's down afterhours
"Agree, I though it was good news. But worry why the stock price dropped so much after hours.. Do you think it was because of the common stock option news or for other reasons?"
Will it even affect share price much?  60M vs the 4B they have?
Why would this make it dip?

Because of the delivery car start to increase the stock shoot up. I think is to hype."

I love seeing new activity in this sub. If you have a NIO car please post a pic id love to learn more about the hardware. Thanks everyone for the positivity!
"Nio only sells cars in China right now so no surprise. From what I know, their cars are very good. Slightly more expensive then a Tesla but a much better car IMO."
"Hi, welcome to r/nio. I completely agree that we don't have enough posts about the car, this subreddit has mostly been stock related. Part of this is the fact that China is isolated from America primarily in language. American social media aren't readily used in China and Chinese social media are hard to access and must be translated. I try to post some details about NIO vehicles and hope to post more about these vehicles both as they remain in China, and possible expand internationally."
Nio doesn't manufacture cars though. They outsource that
"Tesla has changed the game and the incumbent car manufacturers are so well established that it will be incredibly difficult for them to adapt. I believe most of the century-old auto manufacturers will give way to new companies like Nio and Nikola, with Tesla leading the way. If were were able to see a list of the top ten car makers in 2040, I 100% believe that more than half of the companies listed are not household names today."
More expensive than a Tesla? Isn't it cheaper?
ES6 is more expensive than a Model 3
You shouldn‚Äôt be comparing a suv to a sedan
"True. But that's the biggest rival between NIO and Tesla. And from what I know many do compare those two since they are similar in price and are probably the best EVs of that price range. I am Chinese. It's not that people wanna compare an SUV to a sedan, but it's the price point."
"Got it. What are their current price points? There's rumors that ES6 price will also be lowered.

&#x200B;

Also, just curious, are you an American Chinese investor? Or are you a Chinese investor living in china?"
"Canadian Chinese. I think Tesla is going for about 280K RMB for standard + while ES6 begins at 358K. All before subsidies, taxes, etc."
[deleted]
Why would I? This is barely beginning!
I bought more at 6 and honestly kinda regret it but I‚Äôll just have to wait and see if that was the right decision
Smart decision this will likely drop back to $5 & we'll see whether it holds or not
bump
"I did the same, bought at $4 in Jan, sold at $6 last week. Whoops.."
Holding mine all the way to the moon!
"Ya I agree this is just the beginning for the long run. But in the short run, I think this would be close to a little high point."
"I am from the Future, it was a good move."
It‚Äôs the right decision
you may need to hold onto it for a while.
"I think it will drop to below 5, but who knows. Maybe some good news will pop up. If not, I think maybe mid $4."
Ouch
True. Some resistance around IPO price
Lol true
It was a good move
"3,436 vehicles in May. Very promising!"
HOLD
Congrats man. I thought my two $4 contracts were something to be happy about
"No clue if you'll respond to this but I purchased 1 contract at a $3 call for 8/21, obviously up a fair bit now and honestly wondering if I should sell, hold or even exercise this contract and hold the stock? bought the contract at $100, and it' is at 310 now. 
(highschooler with not much money, just learning)"
Finally sold today with a total return of $8000 and bought more calls  ‚úÖ
I hold $7 calls expiring 08/21 too. Yours calls are too deep in the money. I‚Äôm holding to make double my investment.
What calls did you make? I made some 6$ calls this morning I‚Äôm shutting bricks
What are the new calls??
Okay so it‚Äôs pretty much guaranteed to get exercised?
Jan 21 2022 $7 calls. Up 14%.
January 15 2021 calls for $15 and $20
Sold in the mid $4 range to buy back in. Reallllyyyyy kicking myself
In for 500 shares at $3.66.  To the fucking mooooooon!
"Dang that's insane, we're going to $10 in 2020, $20 in 2021, $100 in 2022"
"Doubled my money since March, normally I‚Äôd sell some at this point. Instead I just increased my holding 200%. Wonder if I‚Äôll be strong enough to buy my more if it doubles again."
"This is hype gain, Remember they lose $233mil in Q1 2020."
Will probably go into the 20s if Trump and China keep at it and China decides to retaliate against Tesla
HOLD!
I think a pull back to around $5 is due...
I just wish I bought so much more lol
"We'll go to $20 much sooner than that , I truly believe in it - please look at all my past NIO posts - I have been a long time believer in NIO - IT'S only a matter of time when people will realize so much is already done and everything is established for NIO.

NIO is here to stay for a long long time ........."
This article is about NIOs software and operating system.
Latest news about NIO
"Nice info! Very bullish on NIO long term. Great cars, tech and ecossistem with Nio houses and NIo power."
Thank you! Blue Sky‚Äôs coming!!
"Welcome :) keep going nice info. Good job. With the time you will get better and more relaxed in the videos :) 
NIO is my favorite high risk reward stock right now!"
Thanks for posting!
Thanks for watching!
"Just started.

Highlights:

April solid recovery
Since October es6 outperformed overs ranked top selling electric SUV in China. Only in top 10 selling luxury midsize SUV. 

Overall vehicle sales in China down 40 percent. Nio sales were down 3 percent.

April new es8 commenced deliveries. Up to 580km. Received good reviews. 

Novel coronavirus brought under control. Return to business normalcy. R&d is picking up speed and offline sales are coming back. 

Starting April, NIO exploring innovative sales channels. 44 new nio spaces. 22 nio houses. Continue to expand NIO spaces. Daily new order rate has returned to before coronavirus rate. 

Reaching all time high deliveries in q2. 

Reduction of battery pack costs and manufacturing effeciency and rise in vehicle sale price.

Gross margin to improve. Reach over 5& in 2nd quarter this year. 

Operating loss has decreased.

The progress of battery as a service. Lower initial purchase price and continuous battery replacement. Many patents. 131 battery swap stations. Over 500,000 battery swaps. 

In April, new energy vehicle subsidy encouraged battery swap technology. NIO only premium vehicle brand with EV subsidy.  Planning to release to users in 2nd half of 2020, new battery innovation. 

NIO China. Core businesses and assets including r&d and nio power. Nio China is a subsidiary of NIO. 
NIO has sufficient funds to enhance leadership in smart EVs. 
Fully confident will be closed before end of June 2020."
"Questions:

JAC: We have no details about the VW relationship. More automakers in Hefei would be good thing. If JAC will work closely with VW if shouldn't affect NIO manufacturing. 

Hefei Agreement: NIO China opens the RMB financing channel. We believe NIO China meets the requirements to go public in China. NIO Inc will hold controlling stake in NIO China for the long term. NIO Inc has redemption rights and right to purchase more shares and repurchase rights for partial holdings on NIO China. 

Orders: Since late April order growth rate has returned to rate before Coronavirus. Momentum is very positive. 

Gross Margin Q2: We believe vehicle gross margin over 5%. Overall over 3%. 

US China Relation: Closely monitor.

Capacity: Many users have been waiting for deliveries. Hefei plant monthly capacity 4,000 units at 10 hours daily. Supply chain partners have capacity constraints to 3,400-3,500 units. Boost capacity in overall supply chain system. Plans August and September increased to around 4,500 to 5,000. Quite conservative in production capacity increase. Strong momentum on demand side. 

R&D Expenses: Q1 Cost Control optimizations. Expenses in Q2 increased over Q1. Confident to reduce operating loss. 

NIO Cash: Inject 2.4B into NIO China. Closely monitor market for future financing plans. 

Vehicle Margin: Expect gross margin double digits by end of 2020.

NIO House vs NIO Space: Most vehicle sales happen in Houses and Online. Houses in big cities. Spaces play bigger role in 3rd quarter for lower tiered cities. 70% sales through houses and Online. 

EC6 Deliveries and Price: Start deliveries in September.

100kWh: Start deliveries in Q4. Power density improvement. No performance improvement. 

Hefei: Work together with government to work specific policy. Should be able to be preferantial policy.

Future Product Launch: NIO Day cannot disclose details. Do not want to break tradition of new launch every year. 

Cash Flow: Existing cash can be injected into NIO China. Monitor the market carefully to raise future capital for future development injection. 

Volume: Cannot disclose order backlog. ES8 ramp up production and deliveries. 1 to 3 es8 to es6. EC6 no pricing strategy yet and production."
"What is the purpose of the subsidiary company NIO China? It seems slightly sketchy imo, but I dont know shit so help me out please"
"Firstly, thank you for the summary!  


Honestly, I believe it's quite reassuring that the company still intends to launch another vehicle this year as it shows that the company has the resources and momentum (despite the pandemic) to continue releasing a new product, however, it's a bit disheartening that there's still not much news on EC6 production as it would've been a good contender against the Model 3."
"NIO says it's a way to raise RMB funds, instead of NYSE. It may also be that Chinese investors don't want to invest in NIO Inc and want more of a say in the company."
Why the hell was my post about Q1 earnings deleted
Thanks for the heads up !
NIO TO THE MOON.
Qait how is this gonna affect NIO? Did I missed something in the article?
NIOs factory is a partnership with JAC. JAC might also be considered a major competitor for NIO.
Oh k thanks
"We already know first quarter sales were bad. This earnings is entirely about the outlook, and maybe vehicle margin. If vehicle margin falls, stock price falls. Remember NIO stated they planned to have positive gross vehicle margin in the second half of 2020, if that's no longer the case then I'd be a little worried tomorrow."
"Bought yesterday to speculate on topping estimates rise. Beat them, but the stock is still down in pre market. Probably a bit greedy after a 27% rise in 2 days"
Yea i added some as well. Don‚Äôt worry. If what they are guiding towards is true. We will be fine.
If we can have a slightly better then expected Earnings we shoot to 5 dollars üòé
Very good analysis !! I have always been supportive of this and hoping this year is going to be fantastic for all NIO patrons :)
"I feel that in the midst of a coronavirus, they didn‚Äôt decline as bad as I personally thought. They will back on track firing on all cylinders this year (literally and hopefully!)"
"All I want to know, is this company going to sell enough cars to become profitable?"
"I still believe this is hype, the car sales is starting increase. If they can make each mth increase 10-20%, then It will go back to $10. Probably next years.

From my analysis this Q1 they still not making profit, the others question is how much the debt of this company, Cause this dilute the share."
"Bullshit title OP.

**Proposed** rule will increase financial reporting burden on Chinese companies, which will have minimal/no impact to the large players, but will weed out the small ones / ones with shady accounting practices."
This is a good thing.
I think it is going to be a good one.
20 million were watching it live and over 5000 test drives !! I posted about the fact that I totally fell in love with NIO SUVs.  I really hope electric vehicles will gain more and more traction each year !!
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/nioglobal] [Go NIO :)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NIOGlobal/comments/gm82yi/go_nio/)

"The market isn't responding better because the large increase was expected due to subdued ordering in February/March which led to:

(i) lower numbers in February/March and thus a lower denominator for your comparison

(ii) higher numbers in April as demand was pushed from Feb/Mar to April thus creating a larger numerator for your comparison

&#x200B;

A month over month increase coming out of a pandemic and national lock down in China doesn't seem like a particularly useful data point.

&#x200B;

As to the year over year increase its impressive but:

(i) even if April levels are sustained for the full year the increase would be \~55%

(ii) again, April #'s are probably high as they contain a lot of demand from Feb/March so extrapolating them through the rest of the year might be aggressive

(iii) On the low-end if we extrapolate the first 4 month delivery total (6,993) throughout the rest of the year we get YoY growth of just 2% (not saying this is a reasonable expectation either but the likely bounds are probably 2-55% YoY growth in '20 as things stand).

(iv) 2019 delivery growth was 80% and seen as a disappointment.  '20 is likely to represent a meaningful slowdown vs. '19.  On the other hand, TSLA's YoY delivery growth was (from 2012 when they sold \~3k cars): 765%, 41%, 60%, 51%, 35%, 138%, 50%.  At its current scale NIO is most comparable to the years when TSLA did 41% and then 60%."
"fantastic numbers 

i can't wait for the EC6"
"Thank you very much for the thorough reply
Makes perfect sense üëçüèª"
Great points!
"This means nothing. I used to be a mailman on the side in an industrial area where they had showrooms for Volvo,  Peugeot, Audi, Hyundai and Mitsubishi. These showrooms almost never had many people inside them at a given time. Most often there was at maximum one potential customer  talking to a seller. These brands are all big and sold well during the period I worked as a mailman, but the amount of people in the actual showroom did not reflect that at all."
"I acknowledge this footage is not statistically significant, but your view seems to be based on you strolling around an industrial estate during the working day. This is not when cars are sold or when people come to look around. Did you often deliver mail on the weekend, or in this case a national holiday? What was it like then?"
"In my country (and most countries I have been) these industrial areas are the only places where cars are sold and not in shopping centres or malls. 

I only worked as a mailman on saturdays or during university holidays, so I only went to these showrooms when normal working people have their freetime."
"Thanks for the update. So, from your perspective, what is the point of a showroom? If it is expected to be empty, even during holidays when the mall itself is heaving full of people, why waste the money renting prime real estate? Why not do a Tesla and start with test drives and word of mouth?"
Didn't understand the language because I don't speak Mandarin but the car is awesome !!
"We still own 75% ie 75% of the company‚Äôs future money?

Don‚Äôt see the problem here? They needed cash now, they got it. It‚Äôs good overall for the company regardless of who owns what."
"But the stock price (respectively company  valuation) is also based in its future cash flows, stocks are not only priced based on their current balance sheets.
Surely any future traction and cash this particular company would forecast is hugely speculative at this stage, but doesn't the price reflect the sentiment for the future of this company?
they expect to be gross margin profitable in Q2.. if this holds true, this alone will increase the price of the stock (never mind increase in deliveries and international presence, which Nio is now starting)"
Nice analysis. NIO will still need to raise money as they have yet to figure out how to be a lean company. Auto sales are a must and Tesla is still crushing it....with the Chinese govt assistance. There are also many Chinese EV companies trying to penetrate this market.
On point 3. I thougt this was the other way around. NIO China was injecting US$600 Million into NIO.
Could Nio ever reach Tesla levels?
"The problem is what they had to give up to get the cash - which was 25% of the assets!  Getting cash is obviously good, operationally, for a cash strapped company but what it costs is important and telling about valuation.  Would it be good overall if they sold 99% of the assets for $1bln?  Clearly not so there is some level at which selling a portion of your assets for $1bln is good and some level where it is not - this deal would seem to fall squarely on the ""not good"" side of that line.

That is, the problem is they sold parts of the company at prices which are roughly equal to $1.50/share for NIO.  Large, deep pocketed, intelligent people (Chinese Communist Party officials) with access to lots of information and insight you don't have only paid $1.50/share (and they get the benefit of having most of the money they invest reinvested in their local economies!).  That should tell you something - if NIO could have raised money at a valuation of $3.50/share they would have done it but obviously no one wanted  to invest $1bln at that valuation - large, intelligent investors with good insight into the company are telling you its over-valued."
"You are correct and it is always possible that the Chinese government got a great deal (or we'll all find out they got a great deal).  The thing you should spend time thinking about is:

* Nio needed to raise a large amount of $
* Nio looked everywhere for this money for the past year
* Presumably, no one was offering a better deal than the Chinese government investors
* The Chinese government investors are buying in at a value which implies NIO's stock is worth \~$1.50/share
* The Chinese government investors know more about the business than you (they know things the company hasn't disclosed, they've spoken with the CEO extensively, they've seen income statement/balance sheet information that hasn't yet been disclosed publicly)
* The Chinese investors don't need to get a great return on their investment for it to be a success (since part of the appeal is having that money reinvested in their communities)

It should be concerning that the best price NIO could raise money at is \~$1.50/share when the stock is trading $3.00+.  That's a HUGE gap and implies public equity investors are over-valuing the company since no large financial or strategic buyer was willing to pay anywhere close to the current public market valuation.

Yes, it could be that all the large buyers are wrong and NIO will outperform their expectations but as a NIO equity investor you're starting from a huge disadvantage - you need those expectations to be blown away just to break even at \~$3.00/share."
"I would also just add that your statement "" they expect to be gross margin profitable in Q2.. if this holds true, this alone will increase the price of the stock""

Isn't necessarily true - it's *probably* true but at $3 is NIO embedding an expectation that they turn gross margin profitable?  If they fail to turn gross margin profitable does the stock fall a lot?

Beyond that, buying a stock on the basis that you think an operational metric is going to improve and push the stock price higher is more speculation than investing.  Buying stocks in a vacuum without consideration for the price you are paying and what that price says about future cash-flow, cash raising needs/dilution etc. is going to end in tears."
"Fairly certain the money flows the other way.  The release states "" Further, NIO will invest RMB4.26 billion in cash into NIO China""."
"I cannot answer that question and anyone who claims they can is deluded or lying.

What I can tell you is that the deal agreed to yesterday makes it harder since \~25% of the business was sold at a huge discount to the current trading price of NIO which is itself at a MASSIVE discount to the trading price of TSLA."
Yeah your correct.
"Still, those investors that bought the stock at a discount (it‚Äôs expected btw) are expecting the stock to grow. They are not betting against the stock. If they got a discount, great for them but it does not have any implications on the companies‚Äô future, but only makes makes sure that they are back on track. Whatever nios plan is, I can bet that they are not worrying about a discount but just happy that they are now well funded so they can continue to grow"
"Discounts are expected but discounts of \~50% are not expected for this sort of transaction and are a sign of desperation.  In keeping with that, what you seem to be missing is that people in a better position than you or I to assess the prospects for NIO's future were unwilling to outbid the Chinese government investors.  That is, no one was willing to buy in to Nio China (let alone put new money into Nio) at an implied price of, say, $2/share for NIO but the stock is changing hands in the public markets for \~$3-3.50.   That is a worrying data point and it does matter - a company's value is not binary around ""they are worried about securing funding"" and ""they have secured enough funding for 12 months of operations"" - many more things matter."
"No one said Nio is a guaranteed ‚Äòskyrocket to the moon‚Äô company, it‚Äôs got its early stage struggles like any other company burning out their cash I.e. Tesla. It‚Äôs a gamble for anyone, just because some ppl have a bit more inside information than us doesn‚Äôt mean that they know everything about the prospects of its business - they can only make educated assumptions. 

Furthermore, the pandemic contributes significantly to peoples decisions right now since they don‚Äôt know how things still play out. Put yourself in chinese investors shoes and ask yourself if you would pay more than the given discount during covid 19. Seems to me that the government is betting on nio to grow and is lucky that no one will outbid them because the virus is unpredictable right now, although things seemed to have returned to normal in China for now. 

There‚Äôs so many external factors so don‚Äôt just think ‚Äòinvestors have more inside information than us so therefore the company is going down‚Äô. More importantly, the government is expecting nio to grow so don‚Äôt forget to analyze why they are willing to invest in the company."

To the moooooooooooon
"And now with strong April delivery numbers expected , the stock will get a double jump"
is buying shares right now a smart idea?
Thread carefully:  [https://twitter.com/BergAslak/status/1255392762670833664](https://twitter.com/BergAslak/status/1255392762670833664)
If you're in it for the long haul anything under $6 is a good buy imo. If you want in and out tomorrow might not be good.
we getting rich boisss
@mod can we please keep guys like this out? All they do is spew nonsense and troll. Not even worth bringing up any arguments.
Let me know how it is up there on the moon ill be sitting here contemplating my dumb decision for a lower entry point
"Whats trolling about pointing out unemployment and market sentiment?

Isnt ""well share price is relatively low right now"" more troll? Wheres the dd here? Low in comparison to what time frame? What dd is this based on?"
"Well I bought at avg for 3.97. And only have some cash money in it. Bit still nice to see..

Just buy and hold!"
"I cant mannn, my TA and gut tells me this recession is gonna hit any time now and NIO is one of those that i feel will be impacted."
"Market is forward looking. Same in 2008.

You are just wasting money by waiting sorry man..."
"You're telling me the bottom lasted for two days and millions in unemployments and deaths is irrelevant, ok. That happened in 2008 too huh

Survivor bias of course. ;)"
"And also: a SP of 3.4 is relatively low to what is what priced at before + higher guidance from NIO for next months + new car line. 

The share price dropped hugely cause of lack of funds combined with corona overall."
Well we will see. You have your opinion. The market has as well. Remember US is pumping as never before.
Past performance is not an indicator of future performance
"Its not really an opinion, its stone cold facts- weve hit recession type symptoms and the market is in denial and in fact going the other way. It doesnt make any sense at all and if you think this is a good thing, man- good effing luck and i hope you have an emergency pot stashed away lool"
"Well remind me in 5 months man. 
Remember : money in the market beats waiting to estimate it to drop. But burnt people will be burnt man. Wait longer :)"

The price of your specific option most likely jumped up due to the fluctuation of the option ASK price. It was LISTED for $7.92. This does not mean someone will purchase it for that price.

That isn‚Äôt formal agreement
They have framework only...like MOU. No agreement signed yet. That's what everyone is waiting on. End of April was suggested as signing date. There's been no update from NIO or Hefei on specifics.
Exciting hoping to see sales explode in April. I'm sure quite a few were waiting on the new version
Good catch. I'm anxiously waiting for funding to be finalized.
I'm sure very soon they will release funding finalized news :) very excited .. thanks for sharing this
I haven‚Äôt found these head info
Company is projecting a profit by q2 and double digit profit % by year end. Funding is officially in the works. Sold more cars than ever in q4 2019. I still strongly believe in blue sky coming.
Lost 86%  11k  just hold
"As Warren Buffett would say, be greedy when everyone else is fearful."

"If corona goes away quickly enough this might turn out good in the long run.

Otherwise... doesn‚Äôt look too well.

Will depend on their new car line and how sales are now affected in next months in China.

I only have 100 shares so nothing much really and will keep holding regardless of they will be bankrupt possibly."
You‚Äôre done boy.
You are going to lose everything.  I made 400% gains and bailed.  You should too.
"""... **gross margin** can turn positive in the second quarter and reach two digits by the end of the year.""

Correct me if I'm wrong, but that is not suggesting profit by Q2.  (emphasis added)."
Thank you. I needed some reassurance
[deleted]
*we‚Äôre
Yeah your probably correct. Somebody brought up that question during the call and Li and the CFO did briefly discuss it. I'd have to go back to see exactly what they said.
"Total portfolio, actually lost 14k including unrealized gains too. Lost about 4k in nio but holding gotta average down"
This was kind of scary but still foreseeable future looks good especially with Coronavirus now out of China
Technically the best quarter yet in terms of total sales and net loss. Stock price took a hit today but if you look at the entire market it wasn't too significant. I was hoping for more Hufei news but it's still too soon for that.
"This makes no sense... they got a billion dollars from the city government which also said they are in it for the long term, and they are saying they might not make it? That doesn‚Äôt make sense.  Am I reading this correctly?"
"From the company's own Q4 release.  Read it and make your own conclusion (emphasis added):

&#x200B;

The Company‚Äôs continuous operation depends on the Company‚Äôs capability to obtain sufficient external equity or debt financing. The Company will continue to work on financing projects to improve its liquidity and cash position. However, the consummation of any additional financing project is subject to inherent uncertainties. **Based on the management‚Äôs assessment, as a result of the relevant conditions and events including continuous losses, net cash outflows, negative working capital, negative equity and uncertainties on consummation of the financing projects, there is substantial doubt about the Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern**. The fourth quarter and full year unaudited financial information does not include any adjustment that is reflective of this uncertainty. The Company will announce any material developments or information subject to the requirements by applicable laws."
Nio is about to get bought out
"Yeah, very odd. I quickly read through earnings then joined the call. The entire call seemed uobeat and not once was the possibility of major financial issues mentioned. I completely missed the part about doubt in financial future in the report."
Sold my position. When the company tells you it is likely to fail....I can take a hint.
RIP.
What makes you think that?
"Why Xiaomi NIO? Chinese people like either Expensive Watch or iWatch. 

Xiaomi watch consider cheap."
"For those who afford to buy NIO car, they will own iPhone not xiaomi, those guys will wear iWatch instead of xiaomi watch. Xiaomi is consider cheap brand"
They are trying to build associate alliance as to fight against Tesla +Apple
"We really don't know anything about your situation to determine what kind of investment decisions are suitable for you. I do believe Nio is a good long term (3-5+ years) play. It is not discounted as much as some other stocks right now, but may very well offer more growth potential. Also, consider the rest of your portfolio. If you want exposure to China, Nio is a good speculative play in my opinion."
"Dude if you‚Äôre not in it already I‚Äôd recommend something else. So many good stocks to pick up cheap right now. Google, amazon, apple, Lockheed Martin, Shopify, Qualcomm, Berkshire...so so many. I‚Äôm already deep in NIO and I‚Äôm just waiting to get out."
Fair points! Thank you for the reply.
"Thanks for the feedback, cheers"
"If you bought that google, apple, amazon the gain in 5years might be 50-100%. But if you invest in NIO, if everything went well the gain can be 500-1000% or about that."
"Just expanding for those interested. 

Open interest:
$3 - 50k
$3.5 - 76k
$4 - $32k

The option chain is stating a bearish trend for Nio. Let's see what happens on March 18th - 20th."
707 vehicles is actually not bad at all
"Taking into consideration that there are many auto manufacturers that are completely shut down in China, the fact that Nio is delivering anything is a win."

Likely stock dilution by 67 million shares
Why are you comparing this to Tesla?
"Recently NIO get a lot of funding, what you mean by dilution by 67 mil shares?"
[deleted]
A convertible note is a loan backed by notes that can be converted to shares. 67 million shares at 3.50/share is $235 milllion.
a totally different situation. NIO is in CHINA and that in itself is an entirely different situation.
"I think the further away from January the better out numbers will be. The more China recovers from the corona virus, the higher the stock will go. China is already in recovery as the rest of the world is still in the early stages."
600 to 800
Very low.
Is this range confirmed? Or just marketing stats?
"Yeah, I've noticed the lack of new discussion. I think we're all waiting until Hefei funding gets finalized before anything major happens."
[The Yahoo board for Nio is quite active.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NIO/community?p=NIO) That's where I do most of my reading since this sub is pretty quiet.
"Questions we need answered before we can parse this announcement:

1) Will it be finalized (no way to know that today)?

2) What terms will Hefei demand for the financing?  Jobs, manufacturing facilities, equity, tax revenue?  Media outlets are reporting that manufacturing facilities would be part of the deal and Li is saying after the agreement the company will continue hiring in Hefei (from its current 200 employee base) but other offices won't be impacted.

3) What will the cost of meeting Hefei's terms be to NIO?  Hefei's not writing a 10bln RMB check to defend 200 jobs - they're going to expect new investment worth at least 10bln RMB.

&#x200B;

The stock is selling off because these questions aren't being answer (and, to a lesser extent, because the market as a whole is selling off).  If NIO needs to build a $500m manufacturing facility and hire 2,000 people in Hefei this agreement doesn't help NIO a whole lot.  I'm having trouble coming up with a way this works for Hefei and ends up with NIO having a lot of uncommitted cash in its coffers (or doesn't dilute US ADR investors like crazy)."
Fuck yaaaaaaasssssssss! This is what we've been waiting for. Fuck you Corona virus you bitch. Let's fucking gooooooo!
Up 30% pre market. Let‚Äôs go boyssss
https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/25/nio-shares-surge-as-chinese-electric-carmaker-confirms-funding-talks.html
Up to $5.19 in pre market so far. Will the stock hit $6 today? Any bold predictions?
Why is the market not responding as positively tho .. it‚Äôs not holding its premarket gains... strange
This is insane!! NIO will have enough money to last 6-7 quarters with this new amount of funding. Shame I have nearly all my shares sold as covered calls. Hopefully we don't cross $6 this week.
Looks like we peaked in premarket. But that doesn't take away from the magnitude of this crucial news. Analysts were speculating that bankruptcy was imminent. Hopefully this news will show the world just how fucking useless analysts are.
You'll have a lot baggies at $6 that might take the opportunity to jump ship.
Of course nothing is a sure thing... but I have a feeling today's high will see at least an 8
Because 92% drop in car sales nationwide in China
9$ is not happening. Car Sales nationwide in China fell 92% in January.
"I still believe that Q1 sales will be effect the company stock, virus will be there atleast 2 Quarters, and it takes times for people‚Äôs to willing to spent the $ to buy cars. Just wait I don‚Äôt believe it going to $9 this month or next month.

US stock is down more than 10-20% this couple days. But shenzhen and shanghai stock is up doesn‚Äôt make sense. Wait and see...
Buy only if you believe this discount price and for long term"
$9? Lol üò≠ 23 days so long ago
Coronavirus more like media blowing it out of proportion. More people die from the flu from tobacco and car accidents this is being done to hurt the economy and silence protestors in Hong kong mo

Huh? I was just trying to understand what you are asking?
"As in selling their cars in the US, like how Tesla is selling cars in China now."
"Okay.  Well I am definitely not super in the loop on Nio.

But I understood that them selling cars in the US was always a goal but has been pushed off very significantly... to like 2022 or beyond. 

But I don‚Äôt really know."
Nice DD !!
I wish I had the option to swap my battery in my Tesla Model 3. Would love the option of not being committed to a battery which will eventually degrade over time.
"Nio swap station, more cost effective and more easy to manufacture and the swap speed is 2 minutes!"
" **In respond to the report, Yang Xueliang, vice president of Geely, said, ""I don't know about it, and I don't comment on market rumors."" Nio also said it cannot comment.** 

  
RUMOR"
This is still a rumor. We previously had a rumor of GAC $1 billion.
Well... Time to buy the rumors and sell the news...
Who is the source of these rumors? Are the people who put these rumors out the same one's who made the announcement of the GAC $1 billion announcement? Are they intentionally trying to pump up the price of the stock? So many unanswered questions...
I feel like they might have been considering it then along comes a rumor and scares them away when negative articles start to come out.
"Still only $300 million, but definitely a start."
"China now in the critical stage, coronavirus no body going out, no body will buy the car in feb, NIO have the cash flow issue wait for it"
Funding secured. Let's fucking go!
Where is this info coming from ? Confirmed?
We still haven't seen GAC put any money in.
Its not secured dude did you read the article. The VP of Geely wasn't aware of this? Nio also had no comment.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOO
True enough. Got a little too hyped about it. I'm still pumped by the prospects of it. I know it's only a matter of time until they make the announcement of substantial funding. And this stock is going to pop once that happens.
Isn‚Äôt this still just a rumor? Also what would funding like this be able to do for NIO?
https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-announces-additional-us100-million-private
"Incorrect.  Almost for certain the people behind this purchase are NOT making a bet that the stock will be above $3.07 in 6 months.  They are almost certainly making the bet that they can short \~33m shares above $3.07 in the day(s) after they buy the bond.

What the purchasers are doing is paying $100m for \~33m shares of Nio (\~$3/share) to be delivered 6 months from now.  They then are almost certainly going and shorting \~33m shares in the open market to close out their effective position.  If they short those shares at $4 (around where the stock has been) they raise \~$132m from short sale proceeds.  In 6 months they get their \~33m shares from the convertible bond and use those to close out their short position.  Excluding borrow fees (which currently are quite low) they'll net $32m ($132m - $100m) over 6 months on a $100m investment.  That's a FABULOUS rate of return and a no brainer for the buyer.  Anyone who could would do this trade.  The results/profit from the trade are totally independent of what the stock does; NIO goes bankrupt the buyers make \~$30m (they actually could make more in this one special case); NIO goes to $20 the buyers make \~$30m; Nio stays at $4 the buyers make \~$30m.

The fact that NIO could only raise money on such bad terms (giving away $30m to raise $100m) should be a concerning sign.  News reports indicate they weren't in a position to make payroll this past week and probably needed these funds to do so; this is a terrible sign of dysfunction and financial pain at NIO."
Private investment too. Wonder what the paperwork looks like?
"At this moment is crucial for NIO, the question is the covid-19 effect into china economy as well the industry in there. For sure NIO will hit bad as well in Q1 2019. We can see that the airport in Asia is lose traffic to 10-20% now, peoples stay at home and not spending the money. Recession could trigger so invest wisely in this"
"It is in the best interest of the Asian funds to see NIO go belly up.  They will make their 30M profit, return the 100m, PLUS the rights to assets.  All the stock investors will be left holding empty bags while the like of these Asian funds regroup NIO brand and asset for the relaunch. Then finally the cult investors wake up to NIOed in the ass."
"You're an idiot.

(1) Tencent already owns +20% voting rights of the company in another share class. They also own $30mm of the current outstanding convertible (in addition to last year's note participation). You're right that they're not buying the company but they have a heavy interest in it currently. 

(2) Even more idiotic is your statement. No one is shorting 33m shares (or 60m if you include the second tranche). There's not enough shares to borrow for that to happen. 

(3) Review your 13F filings. There are indeed some hedge funds buying NIO stock as of the latest filings. 

I appreciate your efforts in correcting the misinformation but you should also not spread your own."
Repeating this at Stocktwits would be valuable.
Time to dump nio
"Lots of great points. Thank you! I've been a Long for this stock but unfortunately today I am starting to reverse course. The company just can't seem to get healthy momentum from a funding, production, or sales perspective."
"Isn't this already priced in on Friday? I can see a bit more drop this upcoming week to shake out the weak hands. 6% drop is the norm. This stock is a wild one. It can drop 20% just like that day where they canceled their earnings calls and the day before the earnings call about the bad numbers for their cars, they plunged around 20%."
"Strong language - let's see if you're right.

&#x200B;

1) How does your response contradict anything I said?  Yes, they have a large economic interest in the company (I don't, and haven't, disputed that!) but, contrary to recent posts, have not been buying additional equity.  This despite NIO selling equity at VERY generous terms.  This is a fact and you haven't disputed it so let's move on.

&#x200B;

2) There almost certainly are 33mm shares available to short!  Interactive Brokers (just one broker with inventory from just 5 lenders!) lists "">10,000,000"" shares available to short.  IBKR's system won't display values above 10 million so it could be a much larger number!

[https://i.imgur.com/d6RnijY.png](https://i.imgur.com/d6RnijY.png)

Further, according to Bloomberg, short interest peaked at YE 2019 at 223.8m shares and there were still shares available to short at year end (if memory serves I think availability was still >10m at the time!).  At 1/31/2019 short interest was just 149.7m shares.  That'sa  difference of 74m shares - sure seems like there should be 33m shares available to short!

[https://i.imgur.com/5gWCYmw.png](https://i.imgur.com/5gWCYmw.png)

&#x200B;

3) First off, my point here was in reference to the claim made in another post that Charles Schwab and State Street purchasing Nio shares was ""hedge fund"" buying.  It isn't and I don't get the sense you're trying to dispute that so I'll assume you accept my original point was correct.

As to your conteion that there are, in fact, hedge funds that own Nio - this is arguably true (though again, I'm not seeing any evidence of significant hedge fund *buying* \- either from you or from Bloomberg/SEC Filings - in fact, some recent filings from Temasek and Hillhouseindicated informed investore *selling)*.

As to hedge funds who own NIO I would point out that most of them (i) don't own very much stock and (ii) are not ""fundamental"" long buyers - they're places like Citadel where you have no idea what they're doing and their position probably changes every 2 weeks (they may be selling calls and buying stock as an arbitrage with no clear view on the underlying business).  If you'd like to name some hedge funds who have recently been buying Nio in size (let's say since YE) - I'd be very interested to know!"
too complicated for the stocktwitters. They only read NIO is the Chinese Tesla.
"(1) Not disputing that point. 

(2) Last I heard there's at most $50mm available which means available shares for lending are indeed dwindling. Perhaps it's a result of these funds carrying out your master plan to some degree. Or perhaps shorts got trapped. Who knows. 

(3) Myriad Asset Management."
Nice video man. Hope they can pull the business side of things together.
"Unlikely, regardless of ownership Li retains majority voting rights. Tencent could buy 75% of Nio‚Äôs float and Li would still retain his votes (it‚Äôs in the prospectus). That being said, Li is within his power to approve a buyout. So if Tencent provided a lucrative offer then Nio could get bought out."
Doesn't Li  own 40-51%? and he has the shares in the NIO user trust that he has voting rights of still.
"How to get Tencent to acquire your company:

Step 1: Have a company that exists"
Or maybe GM ü§ì

There were people who doubted that corona virus would have an impact?
"https://youtu.be/fAa-knsM1TM

Tencent increased their stake in NIO"
Yes on some of my older posts when it first began. I also had private messages sent called dumb etc etc. Obviously a virus spreading through a country uncontrolled will have an impact to all businesses.
Article?
"As per this video it's in the sec filing, I'm also trying to search for any other information that I can find, I will keep posted"
I‚Äôd watch it but the vid is over an hour long from a guy I‚Äôve never heard of so I am doubtful of his credibility.. could you summarize the video?

"TLDR:

**NIO delivered 1,598 vehicles in January 2020**, 11.5% lower than the same month last year. This decrease was primarily due to the reduction in business days in January due to the comparatively earlier Chinese New Year holiday in 2020. The extended holiday due to the unfortunate outbreak of the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China also affected our sales results. January 2020 deliveries consisted of 1,493 ES6s, the Company‚Äôs 5-seater high-performance premium electric SUV, and 105 ES8s, the Company‚Äôs 7-seater high-performance premium electric SUV and its 6-seater variant. Total aggregate deliveries of the ES6 and the ES8 reached 33,511 vehicles."
"I sure hope so, I put in a ton of money as well, hopefully something will happen soon to let us know that what we did was worth it."
how many shares do you have?
When did you buy in?
Answer us lol
Yes and make sure you share the results with r/wallstreetbets
Tesla shares are safer in the short term. Deliveries will be bad for the next few months. I do think NIO will secure additional funding. They did enough to bide some time on their 100M note. I‚Äôm sitting out a few weeks with Corona.
Heck no but buy nio in addition
Big No
No
Put this though on hold for about 6 months at least.  Certainly at this time no.
"https://youtu.be/fAa-knsM1TM

Tencent increased their stake in NIO

This seems as per the sec filing, I will try to get more information .."
Lol no!
"Buy, I'm going for the rid 5 yrs holding. NIO is promising."
"Yess, this will take you to the moon"
"\^ Yes, I agree 100% with this (keep TESLA and buy NIO in addition)."
The moon being front page in this case
"I agree from DD done, after heineken virus gets ""under control""."
"
Bought a bunch for my investment class :( let‚Äôs hope this virus subsides soon"
"I'm buying and holding long term for sure with this one. Electric cars are the way of the future and Nio has some neat idea's up their sleeves. The only thing that does concern me is the fact Tesla does have a factory in Shanghai now but, at the same time not everybody can afford a Tesla or wants one. Also the financial standings aren't the greatest but it seems like Nio does a decent job keeping investors in the loop with news. I signed up for the Nio email alert's and get all sorts of new info on the company. I tend to think of Nio as the Kia of its time. Kia started off as a no name company that a lot of people made fun of but grew into a company that makes pretty awesome and well respected cars today. Nio won't grow overnight, but give it time and I think the wait will be well worth it."
Things should get worse before they get better. I would get out and get back in later. That or have money ready to buy more soon.
I‚Äôm just happy I sold at $5.20.
Should I take risk to invest in NIO stocks now guys?
A one yr target of $25!? Seems optimistic?
"If anything, nows the time to buy shares while the rolling rock virus is still a thing. I just think of the keystone light virus as a stock market sale."
The virus will be a temporary thing. For how long?  Can't say. A lot of companies are saying it will take upwards of a year to find a vaccine. For your class you should look into the history of viruses and how they affected the market and for how long. It might make for an interesting topic. Rest assure the market will always recover it's only a matter of time.
no
"Lol but I only got a few months (4 I believe) which fucking sucks, but it‚Äôs easy and I‚Äôm fairly good in the market so I usually get an a anyway"
Ouch! Yeah 4 months might not be enough time. As of right now Nio is heavily shorted and not really stable. If you had a year I think you'd be golden. Good luck though!
"Yeah I invested before the virus shit which sucks, thanks for the luck."
So at like right above $4?

This is amazing. 5 minutes, full battery.
NIO is so well thought out.
I love both NIO and Tesla. Invest in both."
a good shock or a bad shock?
Bad
EXPLAIN TO ME LIKE IM FIVE
For short term this is good for Nio and shareholders. But long term there are still issues and that Nio will eventually run out of money unless substantial finances are in place.
"Like others stated, by diluting the shares, you effectively increased the supply while not having any changes to the amount of demand. This means you own less of the company, but it is not a death sentence. Someone was willing to pay the capital for the shares, so they want to make money, which implies their belief that the company is worth it.  
  
This is all a result of the company not having enough money, either for continuing operations or to supplement their r&d, either way, it all stems from not having enough money."
"I‚Äôm in the same boat, MICHAEL SCOTT."
"Imagjne you have a lemonade stand, but you can't afford to buy cups, lemon, and sugar to keep selling your lemonade.. so you take a loan, but instead of paying interest the person that gave you the loan can convert the loan into partial ownership of your lemonade stand at some predetermined date in the future.  You can continue selling lemonade today because now you have cash from the loan to keep your operations running."
"After the notes mature and they decide to convert it, it will dilute / add more shares and that's why it dropped about 5% today?"
Can you explain to me why this is good short term wise? I‚Äôve never encountered this type of thing
Cash to continue operations.

Hope not because I'd probs be still under water at the buyout price.  $6.25 avg with 1000 shares.
I want anything to happen at this point. I believe we need an investment of minimum $150Mil to get the stock to move positively. I am scared if they dont announce something soon the stock will tank back to 3s or 2s. I have an avrg of 5.80. Hoping for the best.
Won't be Tesla. Will be some desperate as fuck big car company.
"When a company is bought, the stock reflects the buying price that the buying company paid for it(for example, if XYZ agreed to buy Nio @ $6 a share, then the price per share would instantly be $6 per share and would likely rise with new people buying in over the excitement that Nio will be saved)"
I would like to know what happens in case of take over.
No
Or Rimac???
"I don‚Äôt think any large car company is gonna take on the model of housing, lounges and battery replacement stations. Nio is on its own. They obviously have a ton of government support, they‚Äôve sacrificed a lot, and they really don‚Äôt want to fuck this up either."
What about GM
But also no doubt this next quarter is gonna be shit. Stock is gonna drop. Thank god for options.
They could abandon it. The best thing about nio is it's range
"Na, probably not. But he can take a nice chunk of the luxury market share with a home-grown version of Tesla."
He is not Elon Musk. Not even 1%.
I do agree about this
"I disagree, he is at least 10% Elon Musk. He has a vision for the future of his country."
It will be really difficult for Elon musk to take over the Chinese market for cars. You will more than likely see them struggle for years. Chinese markets are some  of the hardest markets to get in. There is a culture diffrence that you have seen many major brands fail at getting into.
You are mistaken.
Again you are mistaken and but only time will tell. Just wait and watch.
"No, you are misinformed and probably a fanatical Musky-teer"
I‚Äôll be watching but I‚Äôm a big believer in history repeating itself. Chinese consumer market is very different from America‚Äôs. Best of luck.
Down 10% on NIO when will it go upüò≠üò≠
You should have really excited your positions earlier this week. It is not too late to exit and convert to FXI puts.
"Hah, the market in general just searches for an excuse not to go up"
How do you think this will go... like will there be many more deaths?
Damn virus who would of seen this coming im down over 30% on my portfolio im only invested in nio and luckin coffee this blows!!!!
Seriously luckin dropped to $28 because of a short seller dropping a report of fraud supposedly what great timing looks like it recovered most of its losses
I think so I think it will get worse before it gets better there thinking like summer it will peak
"Rip I‚Äôll pray for you, NIO keeps dropping and I keep putting more inüòñ"
"Luckin Coffee is down due to alleged fraud from a questionable anonymous report that was retweeted by a shorting firm.

The alleged fraud is nonsensical in scale, no possibility of there being fraud to the degree they alleged."
Are you positive results on stock twits?
wow that's not good. i think they'll create a vaccine before then. maybe in 2-3 weeks.
That‚Äôs what these short sellers do. Same thing happened to APHA. They defame the company and make bank.
I'm hoping so that would be awesome save a lot of lives and my portfolio lol
"Everyone is saying that chinese stock market will tank this week. i think they have rules though to prevent crashes. i hope it doesn't drag down the us market. 

even still can create a buying opp. when news of a vaccine gets out the market will bounce back."
You were right Chinese government blocked people from selling
"Well if we get funding, and they actually achieve positive margins on the vehicles. We should see $10."
Probably $8
Hope so seeing a lot of red üò¨
"Red, red wine! We see red now but we celebrate later."
I‚Äôm getting burned by NIO when will it bounce backüò≠
"It'll be tough for NIO to survive, but if they do, sky's the limit."
Its being heavily day traded ! I was all in but all this china news is hard to get around plus there evacuating city who‚Äôs going to build these cars? and who‚Äôs going to be buying them? At the moment too much risk ! If it tanks will add long
"This stock too speculative at this momment, The latest News GAC Will invest $150mill to NIO. 

There are several issue in here
NIO is out of money to burn $250mil
If they success get funding $150mil that roughly 400mil cash. Remember last year the Q1 the cash burn out is $400mil.
Tesla is coming on China (people like to get this as a status of social to Show up)

By right the valuation of their stock should be $2, because of the funding in talk with GAC. It shoot up to $5, Now It back to $4. (Over valuation)

They really Need to get atleast $1bill to stay for a years. They Need to increase the sales each month like 10-20% (which right Now on track)."
"Hard to see them having a good 2020. With little cash for operations, no apparent funding, and the virus pandemic, their best hope at this point is support from the government. Otherwise, they will fold. Thoughts?"
JC on webbull is a good source.
Nio space Facebook
"Seems like some employee runs it, if you ask me."
I do appreciate the uptick in content and comments in this sub.
"Yeah, we have been steadily growing over the last year or so. We saw a big growth after q3 earnings."
"Lol well, not a lot of ‚Äòactual‚Äô investors/ brokers actually sit through reddit. They have better sources..."
"What was the number of followers prior to their earnings report in December?

Btw not all investors look to reddit for help"
Thank you for letting me know. It's super amazing how nio has only less then few thousand subscribers.
Probably would better to compare the growth relative to other similar subreddits as opposed to absolute numbers.
True
"Sadly, I personally have not been tracking this data. I do remember a large increase in December."
"About 440 in early december.
https://subredditstats.com/r/Nio"
Tesla is literally destroying everything in its path on its way up...crazy...
I love you NIO!
Eps?
At this point I hope we can just hold $4+ this week.
"Big drop pre-market.

Don‚Äôt get your hopes up"
I love you both

What did they update ?

No just lane assist and braking I believe
"Translation: Donated goggles have been used. The first batch of goggles donated by our # toner club has been delivered to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital a few days ago.

 I'm stating that the virus is going to affect the bottom line. I hope it doesn't but its not looking good in China in the short term.
"NIO isn't a stock you hold short term. Anyways, modern medicine is good enough that we'll find a cure. It's not like a Spanish flu-like epidemic is going to ravish the earth and kill 50 million people like the media wants you to believe.

The market has seen countless scares like these in the past and has always recovered, and with great return. Also, glancing at the chart for the DOW, etc. people might think we're in a bubble. But the market is entirely different from the dotcom bubble. The way the economy works is that its value increases as it works and grows. That's why the chart always goes up. It represents the economy, not a single company.

Just some words to ease fears."
This one pharm company produced a vaccine candidate within hours of the virus dna being sequenced. I'm seeing reports of human trials beginning in Summer.
Summer!? Omg that's a while
Must have been deleted I don't see it
Is this fake news? I don't see anything of this sort on their twitter feed.
Is this fake news? I don't see anything of this sort on their twitter feed.
f off
f off
No its not fake news it was obviously deleted. Someone made a mistake lol.
It's still showing up on my end ill make a video so i can prove it's not fake didn't known would get so many stupid messages in my dm
It was taken down
Buying opportunity.
"there's nothing to fear. current price affected by virus panic and simple fact that entire Chinese stock market has been shut down completely last week, which gonna scare investors further out. so once the mass hysteria will pass, the stock will rebound. personally i see only a buying opportunity. gonna keep watching at falling knives for now. we haven't approached bottom yet"
I'm holding as well. Bought at $3.60. Will hold until I see a mass boom whether it goes back up to $5.60 or as low as $1 I'm gonna hold no matter what
Holding may buy more
"Price gapped down in after hours/pre-market along with the rest of the market, likely on coronavirus fears. Nio (and the rest of the market) seems to have already found support. I'm not worried about the near term price action unless the coronavirus situation worsens considerably."
Sold 6k at 5.08.  Too scary.  W4 will kick ass but dilution fears got me out.
Gotta hold on
Holding and buying more what a dip today
Sold at a loss unfortunately. Might buy more if it shows signs of popping back up
buying more if it gets to a certain number. Stay strong.
Buy more once the cure starts going around this will shoot back up
I wouldn't fear any dilution until we get over $6/share
Don't blame you this could get a lot worse before it gets better I'm holding I can't get back in at my price
"I doubt the Chinese government will allow this. Nio is the only company that stands as a direct competitor to Tesla. While Tesla's endeavors in the Chinese market are part of a joint venture with a Chinese company, I suspect the Chinese government will do everything it needs to support a purely Chinese competitor."
"Won't happen. Tesla still needs to focus on profitability, and pay down its debts. I don't think shareholders would be happy if Tesla spends a billion or more on NIO. When Tesla recently did a stock offering to pump up their balance sheet."
If only. If this happened I would say buckle up because we would go to the moon!
"What does Nio have that Tesla doesn't? Unless a company has game changing technology, I don't think Elon would even take a second look. And like someone else mentioned, the Chinese government would probably never allow such a thing."
"At this point, I can see one day (can't really time it like bitcoin, but that's the point of investing) where the news (elon's tweets) will say tesla is looking to buy nio and the stock jumps +40% or more in one day"
battery swap tech
I can honestly imagine that too. He‚Äôs really close with the Chinese government. Maybe they can arrange some sort of deal. Without any funding Nio will be bankrupt in 3 months.
It might be the same or slightly lower now that this virus is spreading around.
Just learned that all NIO stores will be open during the holiday. Serious about selling cars.
"CNY For sure will impact the sales, since most people staying in house. That also included the virus breakout, there are 1300+ cases and 41 death reported. More or less people will stay in their own home."
Virus has no impact on car sales lol
I dont know some people in China scared to go out could affect a couple sales when sales are this small 5-10 makes a big difference
People are highly encouraged to stay at home. Even Chinese workers. So that's saying a lot.
"Yep. Look at the price movement like jd, alibaba, Baidu for today. They all are trading the same pattern. Possibly the same machine and group trading these securities"
Yea it's been a weird pattern like ai or something my portfolio looks very spiky not a slow drop just a sharp straight down line and straight up and down all day. I only am invested in LK and NIO so I'm hurting today waiting and can't buy fast enough üòû
[removed]
Wtf üòÜ
Wish I could afford more than 50 measly shares. If it dips again next week I may sell off some other stock and try to get up to 100 for the ride up.
Seriously what was that lol
Holding Nio shares are not for the faint of heart...
Their Negotiators are hard at work.
"my plan next week:

Sell NIO Monday

Sell 2 tesla stock, 

Buy 80 AMD for Tuesday 4th Quarter reports. 

Ride the AMD wave for the day. 

Sell AMD Tuesday evening

rebuy 2 Tesla

Repurchase NIO 

????

profit"
Why the fuck would you even waste your time investing only with 50 shares lol
Especially with Margin.
Nice to see I‚Äôm not the only one who has to play that game and doesn‚Äôt have a seemingly endless bankroll. I just get to play with my leftover money after bills. Married with kids is a downer sometimes. Good luck to you!
"I don‚Äôt know, because it‚Äôs better than zero I guess?"
Touch√©
"No update, not secured"
Woohan wooooohan I got you ALL in check.
Nothing official yet....
The original story was NIO to build 200 more houses
"Yeah, I've noticed this myself. Hopefully it means they are busy dealing with potential funding press releases and such."
150million It Only allow them to survive 2 mths with the cash burn rate. Too speculative this stock becarefull
Screw Twitter. Nio is a Chinese company. Maybe you should check out weibo or something
Stock will go down to 3 if we don‚Äôt get news soon. Be aware
Fuck sakes
Get more because its going to 6
I only bought a few at 4.20. Should I wait for another dip or just get in some more ASAP?
"Back with NIO with 600 @5.09
Go NIO you can do it!!!"
Stop loss kicked in this morning by 1 cent! Sold with a profit but missed out on today's juicy gains
Hells Yeah
Keep in mind we're still waiting for any news on funding.... Whether that be good or bad.
"Aaaaand it‚Äôs gone

  
  
Edit: and it‚Äôs back let‚Äôs gooo"
"Bout in at 4.53, this stock has been a bitch to watch. Please make me some profit"
I predict a lot of resistance at $6. Lot of baggies will want to get out
Get more now.
"Hahahaha oh nio , makes crypto look like bluechip stock"
Pretty much what's happening right now
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Hah! This üëÜ
Can you explain why dilution is good for us?
"(Edited)

At the face of it, it may seem like it‚Äôs not good because you lose a bit of your overall % ownership. But the pie is getting bigger, and a smaller piece of a much bigger pie means more money in absolute terms.

Example:

When u own 20% of a company that‚Äôs worth $1m, you may get diluted several times after additional rounds of equity financing.. and end up owning 5% of a company that‚Äôs worth $10m

20% of $1m = $200k, whereas 5% of $10m = $500k (hence dilution is good).

That said, this normally works when the value of the stock keeps going up as the additional funding and dilution occurs, and not when the value of the stock is dropping (except if the additional funding, even at a lower valuation, can help pick up a company‚Äôs valuation ‚Äòeventually‚Äô..)

So in Nio‚Äôs case, two things could have happened (assuming Bailley bought new issued stock, hence dilution):

Option 1: If Bailley bought the stock at $4.4 (current trading price) that‚Äôs (in theory) ‚Äòbad‚Äô dilution ... because it would be a ‚Äúdown round‚Äù compared to their $6 IPO price. Unless, as I mentioned earlier, this additional capital, even if at a down round, can help propel Nio to gain more substantial traction eventually and the eventual value of the stock will be much higher in the future, so we all win, despite aggressive dilution initially. That would be the worst case scenario at the face of it (but hardly that bad since it‚Äôs only 30M shares of 730M shares), however, it would have a happy ending eventually (if the company can keep growing)..

Option 2: Nio goes to new 3rd party investors (e.g  Sovereign Wealth Funds) and manages to convince brand new shareholders to buy new stock at $6, $7, $8, etc in which case, Bailley has, as traditional existing large shareholder do, a clause called ‚Äúfirst right of refusal‚Äù. It means they have the priority to buy any new issued stock before the new 3rd party. Why is that? Because big existing shareholders like Bailey have substantial voting power that they don‚Äôt want to lose to dilution, so they‚Äôd rather buy any new stock, even if more expensive (assuming a 3rd party is willing to pay that expensive price), so that they maintain or even increase their shareholding portion for voting purposes, etc. so Nio would basically go to its existing big shareholders and say ‚Äúhey, the Saudi Public Investment Fund (for example) wants to buy new issued stock for $6 per share. You guys can buy that new stock first before them, but if you don‚Äôt, we will take the Saudis offer). That‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter dilution‚Äù than option 1, because new stock is issued at a higher stock price compared to scenario 1

Point is. Dilution means a drop in % ownership per investor (which means an effective drop in share price) in order to raise new interest-free financing (better than raising debt because there‚Äôs no interest on it, and they don‚Äôt have to pay it back, unlike debt financing). 

So if u believe Nio will do great if it can only get its hands on some more cash, given its growth and the macro situation in China, then u would want to sacrifice a tiny initial drop in share price (initially) due to dilution, 4-5% tops, which will then recover eventually in folds. 

With all that said, even after the announcement today, the stock price did NOT drop. I think this is exactly because of what I just said, because net net, this is good news for Nio‚Äôs cash situation and its ability to now deliver on its potential.

All of the above is assuming we are talking about brand new issued stock. It is also likely Bailley bought old stock (as a normal public trade, a big one!), which is also good news because it means their biggest shareholder now wants more skin in the game while they can. 

Either they know something good we don‚Äôt, or they just believe in the company enough based on their recent due diligence."
"Thanks for taking the time for the clarification. I hope it‚Äôs option 2, but either way, just need funding . The future looks bright."
"Btw just read that top shareholder Baillie Gifford co. just bought 30 million shares today, now totalling 105 million. This company isn't going anywhere"
"Bought 25 at 9.00, the rest of my 264 shares brought between 2 and 4 dollars. Thinking of buying more.."
I've been lowering my avg down since it was $10. Now have 5400 shares with avg of $4.80.

"2000, bought 1000 at 3.48 on 1/7/20, picked up another 1000 this week, avg price 3.97"
"I own 339.92 with the average cost basis of $2.69. I bought in under $3 but then with the recent dip below $2 I got spooked! I actually sold a bit at those levels but when NIO rebounded to $2 I bought back in and had over 500 shares. I recently I took out some profits and I am waiting for the next dip to but up! Until then I'm trying my best to hold strong!
I'm telling myself not to be greedy! GLTA!"
"I had 400 at 1.30 and sold at 3.50ish
I am purchasing 1000 for long term. The latest NIO news convinced me that NIO stock will skyrocket"

1322 shares with an average cost of 3.33 I'm ready for it to go to the moon. üöÄ
"I think your buys and sells are bullshit and I‚Äôm calling you out.  Post all the NIO transaction on here.

I bought 6,000@3.33"
"Had to do the same. Went in heavy above the $10 mark. Kept buying on its way down to below $2. Started getting really nervous when it hit $1.25 per share. Ended up with 19,900 shares at around $3.85. Sold them all on Thursday. Should've waited until the Friday for an extra 7% but ces't la vie.

I'm looking to reestablish a position below $4.50. Anywhere below $4 and I'm going to start loading up."
Lowering his cost basis finally.
Buckle up everybody!!!
Possibly sold some of their Tesla shares and reinvest into nio
Whats this form?
"Of course it‚Äôs good news; Baillie Gifford and Co. were already one of the biggest shareholders. 

Two scenarios:

1) If Nio just issued new stocks, normally this means their existing major shareholders have the ‚Äúfirst right of refusal‚Äù, which means they get the priority to buy any new stock the company issues before any new buyers pick up the new stocks. If that‚Äôs what happening, that means Nio just picked up $130M in additional funding (interest free funding, since it is equity funding not debt funding). In which case, all of us shareholders would get diluted and lose approx 4% of our stock value in theory (which is nothing in the world of Nio and I‚Äôll happily give up even 10% of my stock value if it means Nio picking up $1b in cash to keep building on its momentum. I think that‚Äôs why you see the stock still going up despite a small dilution.

B) If the announcement is for existing stock, not new stock (I.e a big trade), then it‚Äôs also good news because it means one of their biggest shareholders wants more skin in the game. But I didn‚Äôt see a trade of 30M shares take place (I‚Äôm not a trader so I don‚Äôt have visibility traders have)."
I would assume the news would have catched on already?
Ok I'm getting 1k shares tuesday
Is this a good thing?
Companies required to report when an investor that owns more than 5% of a company:  [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedule13g.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedule13g.asp)
"Awesome, thanks for the explanation! This is kind of what I thought it meant which is why I posted this."
I think so
And this means ? That someone invested 5% and believes Nio isnt going bankrupt?
I have no idea. I literally know nothing about the stock market and am completely rolling the dice. Please don't listen to me I am a random guy on the internet. I had to google what the form was.
I just picked up a 1k shares of NIO so should be bankrupt within a few months.
Financing is the only thing holding this back from IPO range. I'd expect a run up to $6 several days after financing is confirmed. HOWEVER I then would expect Nio to issue new shares once we reach $6 again.
"I've been watching it constantly. Not sure what to do at this point, majority of my shares were bought in the 2-3 dollar range and some were at IPO levels. I'm very hesitant, on the one hand I would be interested to see how it performs long term. On the other, I can cash out and make a few easy bucks lol."
I already loved nio now I'm in love üòÑüòÑ
"Yeah I‚Äôm fine with 10-15% dilution , this is nothing in the volatile world of nio stock anyway and will give them enough cash to get their shite together"
Went as low as 3.91 per share and then ended up closing at 4.37. Lots of movement. Nice to see it finishing in the green.

"I‚Äôm not sure what the fuss is about
We all know nio is discussing financing projects, they just confirmed what the previous article also said , which is that funding is being discussed with GAC, but is not secured .. 

relax, hold, and wait for the actual news when it happens. The company isn‚Äôt going anywhere anytime soon."
"**Conspiracy theory** 

Nio leaks the funding confirmation rumors, to see how high the stock can climb, stock gets halted, they deny the rumor, then later on announce actual funding and the share price rockets. 

THEN issues come convertible bonds @ $6 ASAP."
"Kind of the same behavior Elon does when he tweets. Buy the rumor, sell the news"
Yeah and I've never seen Tesla haulted ... although maybe it did when he said he was taking the company private for 420 a share.. I dont think it did get haulted then

Fo sho. Been sitting on this one for a while.
How many shares you have 10?
"Hmm
Pump and dump?
Or just looking to make quick gains?"
"It‚Äôs funny, I see it in the Tesla page but not on the NIO page..."
Huh?
See original post just edited it
Yeah I hear you. Media just can‚Äôt give the man a win. this is why Ancy Nancy decided to forward articles of impeachment today too to distract from the phase 1 deal and steal headlines typical.

"It seems to have adjusted down to the news , but to me, the release echos the earlier news. Discussions are happening , that‚Äôs confirmed.. no funding is secured yet, that also was confirmed.

There was a market watch story within nios stock on Robin hood and now it's been deleted?
"Amazing, thank you!"

I found the article and posted it so if it's confirmed im guessing $5-6 a share
You can find that article on yahoo finance
this might be a reason why tesla or toyota or vw will buy NIO
"Only $200 million USD, hopefully NIO can get $1B..."
"This is false News, is in talk with GAC. Still haven‚Äôt confirm. And the value No more than $150mil confirm by GAC."
Any English coverage on this?
https://technode.com/2020/01/10/gac-nio-1-5-billion-funding/
"This didn't age well, NIO lost all its steam at market open. We'll be luck to if we end up green today."
"The company only having 200mil cash, in 1 quarter they will run out of $. Unless they sell additional stock or find investors. I expect it will go down $1."
"Bag holders taking profits I knew when I saw the ""analysis"" writing headlines about a premarket jump that it was a classic gap and trap"
indeed :(
"You don't need to be that pessimistic. Actually its any day now they'll run out of money.

They could offer $1 per share convertible bonds to the current top share holders and they'd eat that up. **I wouldn't expect it to drop below $1.44** sales have improved a lot since their all time low, and they have been cutting costs.

Also look at Tesla the last time they issued stock, the stock went up in price."
Sigh. Guess we're going to have to wait for the Q4 report and an announcement of funding before we see some positive movement that actually sticks.
"I noticed one of these... :( 



 So here take this... :D"
Stock up on the dips üòâ hope it dips a little more sorry everybody need more lol
I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good
Up 11% in pre market. Let's fucking go!
Got to love nio everytime there is good news there is a huge sell off.
8224 vehicles delivered in Q4.....can we see $5-$6 per share this week???
[deleted]
Nearly every single time. It‚Äôs so frustrating.
"buy the rumor, sell the news"
Happens.. I too was a weak hand before. Sold fb after it dropped 25%. Learned to dollar cost average and hold for the long term even if it meant losi g all my money.
"Panic selling is a bitch. I've been a victim of it many times. Eventually a part of you dies inside and accepts the possibility of bankruptcy. I continued to hold while Nio was being punished below $1.50 per share. 

I was paying way too much money in interest just to hold the dying stock in my margin account. I'm almost back to my even price and I don't plan on selling until it hits minimum $8 per share.

To be honest with you, the share price is still heavily discounted. The sentiment of the stock is going to turn around once they announce funding and they have a profitable quarter. It might be worth jumping back in. Whatever you decide.. Good luck!"
I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good
Second Chinese auto startup to IPO in ths US. Seems smaller and not as successful as NIO....
"Lixiang sells a vehicle similar to the Chevy Volt. It has a gasoline generator that will charge the battery once the battery depletes. 

Pros - Lixiang owns a factory from a legacy ICE manufacture plant they acquired. 

Will be in the price range to compete with the ES6/EC6. 

&#x200B;

My guess is it won't be attracting EV customers, like how in the US market people stopped shopping for Hybrids once good EVs came out. They'll most likely only be getting ICE buyers."
Very interesting. And they actually have their own manufacturing plant
I'll check this company out but they don't seem like a threat to nio
Nice headline WSJ lol
The hate for any Tesla‚Äôs competition is real.
"Western media always hate on foreign competition, there‚Äôs room for competition to get us off oil"
Lol. Odd headline from WSJ. I don't recall them blatantly throwing shade at companies like that.
"Comments 66

A couple of things to counter your point:

On margin, higher volume will lead to better gpm as you have better negotiating power with suppliers. Also, nio guarantees a minimum to be paid to Jac, and nio volume is not close to the minimum amount yet. So more volume will help with that gross margin. I believe company said they expect positive gpm for 2020

On volume, I think it's the key here. Nio has 70 nio spaces + nio houses now and they plan to do 200 totla by Dec 2020, this will for sure boost the volume as you expand into more locations. Also, company comment that for the past 2 months, orders have been 100+ per day, which means Nio can simply push out 3000+ monthly easily with just current orderbook, excluding any new orders you can get from more nio sites. In addition, nio said 45% of its customers are referred by existing... So that shows the brand loyalty here and imagine the compounding effect here. I would imagine it will be very easy for nio to get 4000 per month by March (Jan is only half a month given cny, and Feb inventory will be too low because of the cny impact as well to production)

Funding. 190.5 mm of the cb money is basically in, don't know the reason why there's still 10 mm not in but 90% of the ceo's commitment is fulfilled showed commitment at least. Nio will definitely need cash infusion in the next 1-2 months, but how they go about it is interesting. At 4 bn market cap, I would imagine it wouldn't be hard to do a private placement to existing large holders for 500 mm at a 15% discount? If nio can show progression for #1 and #2 above, I see no reason why people would not give them money, at 15% cheaper. We can check tesla's chart to see what happens to the stock price when they completed their funding (hint: it goes up). If you listen to the nio day, the chinese replay of earnings, and what company said during the shareholder meeting, it was clear that the new cfo wanted to use this earning to get the stock price up and THEN do a placement. The battery as a service concept which bin li mentioned about 5 times (even when people didn't ask) give you some sense that the earning call was basically a pitch to the institutional investors participating in the placement...

Battery as a service. I think it's a concept people still don't quite get. The way bin li talked about the battery as a service concept is huge and will for sure attract a lot attentions because it's essentially a reit concept where you manage the battery for customers and charge x% yield per year. Insurers and pension money would love to invest in that type of business if the gov really pushes for it (check the white paper, it's being mentioned quite a few times). The only other company doing it is baic, but they do only for taxis which is very bad. Unquestionably nio is the leader in this battery swapping concept now"
"This isn't funding for NIO, it just comes from NIO Capital."
Thank U
Believe I saw someone comment on that saying they are in talks with someone but its confidential at the moment.  No links so I can't confirm anything yet. Will dig more
"They got a lot of American money over the last year with their shitty stock action.  But yes $200M was confirmed earlier , although that last about a month.    It will be OKa"
"They've been in talks for quite some time now. Hopefully, something will happen soon."
Maybe they'll put a link on their site or it could be on the. Nio app they might also share it via Facebook or twitter they have accounts on these platforms
"I have no clue. Wondering this myself. My guess is it will be mostly chinese with limited english coverage, although the stock is traded in the US. I doubt anything will be live streamed."

"Couldn't find any links on their social media accounts, which is a stark contrast to their publicity of Nio Day."
Yeah I can't find it either ill search the web see what I find and I'll share it if I find it
"Well, stocks >50 % up that is"
lol
Tried to short at $4.35 but ETrade said they could find any shares.
"They‚Äôre standing up now, it‚Äôs goin down :("
Get rid of e trade dawg
Why?
Up 20% in pre market. Fuck yes! Let's go!
Gotta/ gonna beat that $3.00 wall baby
"Interesting tidbits from the call

* **45% of orders came from existing NIO users**
* More data needed to see if NIO Spaces or NIO houses are better for operations
* 2020 - Should achieve positive gross margins across all vehicles."
Waited 8 months for this moment to break even a d be up overall. Patience was key
$3.40 high of the day! On fucking fire!
Has Nio hit its reach then if essentially half of the orders came from existing users/owners? Is the market and demand for luxury NEV not as big as they anticipated?
$3.96 now!
"There are about 750,000 NIO app users."
High of $4.87. Fucking love it!
"Surely not each of them own a vehicle though, right?"
It hit 4.87?  Or is that a typo?
Right anyone with a phone in China can download and use the app.
"Yes crazy day up 90% at one point. 

We still need to know about new funding. They have 1 Quarter left in the bank. If the stock gets back into the $5-6 range soon, I expect NIO to issue more shares very quickly if that happens."
Hopefully. Q4 should be even better.
Fucking wow indeed! This stock is on fire today. I saw it hit over 90% return today. Laugh out fucking loud!
One day left.
Yeah I was watching like no way! This is awesome it might do a pull back but I don't care I know this isn't going to stop
"My heart wants it to be a positive report. But my gut and brain are telling me that the stock price will dip. 

There's a reason they changed CFOs and delayed the earnings report for this long. They might be hoping to mitigate the negative earnings report with a positive outlook for Q4 earnings and announcement of new funding. 

I think 2020 is going to be a great year for the company. But I think we're going to feel the burn in the short term. Here's hoping I'm wrong."
Hopefully a jump up. Rumors are they will announce new funding.thats been their biggest drag
"Depending on how bad the blood bath is I sold quite a few puts, she dips below 1.50 I'll be the proud one of 6k shares hahaha.."
"From the NIO Day event it looks like, NIO desperate to increase the sales. A lot of price deduction for the early order. So tomorrow confirm they lose another huge $. The price will be less than $1.5 and can be less than $1"
I feel it's going to be a blood bath I just hope NIO doesnt go bankrupt in 2020! I'm over 500 shares deep so I am bullish in the long run but damn they bleed money so I don't think tomorrow is going to be too hot!
"2020 will be the year for nio I truly believe after this er is bottom, only up from there. Would be nice seeing a suprise good news!"
Damn this didn't age to well üòÑ
"Woooo congrats anyone that bought! This things a winner winner chicken dinner@ my puts that I are worthless ! I sold for profit,  resold somemore at 3.50 just bought them back.. if only all days were like today up 900 bucks... if only I would've bought more shares... currently only holding 46 shares lol @ 2.27"
"Its going to be like that techno song ""down da da da-down, down down down, da da da-down.""


However, I am hopeful for the long term for NIO but I'm erroring on the side of caution and I pulled out in friday last minute to ride FCEL up then pulled out of there too. Now I'm cashed out and watching. I could be wrong but I made a tidy sum already so I'm content."
I am happy to report that I was wrong. Up 20% in pre market. I've never been more happy to be so wrong.
If it gets below 1.5 I would happily buy another lot
good luck. i'm watching from the sidelines.
Very likely. The event they put on with Nio Day 2019...if they are strapped for cash like most people have been reporting - that event should leave a crater in their financials. It looked huge. Wondering if folks can chime in on the magnitude of Nio Day and how they were able to gather funding for that. Was it as big as it appeared online?
"China is a big market and their populace is also getting wealthier compared to America. Hence my bullish outlook on Nio. They can also go sell in Europe, India and Singapore"
Is FCEL worth getting into in Jan?
Can't believe that this stock was up over 90% at one point today. What a fucking ride. I'm not going to even consider selling my position until Q4 earnings. But congratulations to anyone who was rewarded today. Spend it in good health.
Yeah that was my thought exactly! Figured make some money selling puts and lowering my ava substantially if it goes below 1.50 before or on 1/3
"I think so. It may even go up on monday but my gut told me to pull out for a few days to let the pressure off. I think this next year will be a hydrogen fuel shootout. This election will be drumming up all sorts of buzz for green energy. Not all of them will make it, but Im betting a lot of money will be made on speculations much like the weed rush of the last two years. 

I'd jump into FCEL anywhere below a $1 and especially below $0.80 if it dips that far, but maybe even under $1.15. 

Do your DD."
"Beautiful car, well designed and in wonderful colors, but more importantly the best EV technology in the world and the ONLY EV in the world with AI inside; also, supported by thousands of charging station and one-of-a-kind battery swap stations. Love it!"
Looks legit. Priced in at around 50k I believe. Well positioned to compete with Tesla.
I don't like how similar the name is. ES6 / EC6
Reminds me of the BMW SUV x6 I believe it's called
"I am rooting for Nio but I was not impressed by the EC6. Not from the photos I've seen anyway. By the looks of the Nio Day 2019 presentation, the company is putting a lot of stock into their Nio Life and Nio House/Space divisions. This worries me a bit."
Why no spec and price ? Seems like a attempt to boost the stock.
I love my little stock that could!
4 shill post made the last two hours. Just wait for Monday man.
"to me, it looks literally like BMW 5 series Gran Turismo.

I see where they got their inspiration from for this car."
I believe some specs were announced. No price yet.
Shill post?
"According to urban dictionary: 

shill - a person engaged in covert advertising. The shill attempts to spread buzz by personally endorsing the product in public forums with the pretense of sincerity, when in fact he is being paid for his services.

You're probably just excited. I don't blame ya."
"Lmao not a shill. I'm a very real person. I hold 3000 shares in Nio and have averaged down from $6.70 to $2.28. I have never been paid by Nio or anyone associated with Nio or anyone that has anything to do with investing. I have a YouTube channel by the same name. I'm a music producer that likes Nio, a lot and I like to share what I find out so others are aware and make their own decision. I don't ever tell anyone to buy or to sell sometimes I encourage the longs to hold strong. I just like to share my opinion and whatever I find in the NIO app that might be relevant. I saw the Nio Reddit was getting no love after the first crash and decided to join the Reddit community to share. You are right about the excitement  I'm very excited of what this company can become but I promise not a shill however can't say the same for whoever made the similar post to mine üòÑ Take care hope Monday brings big gains but if it doesn't ill just buy more üòâ"

"No doubt, they're haters.. I'm bullish here. I'm thinking it drop mainly because I sold 20 2.5 puts 1/3 expiration yesterday.  Merry Christmas to you as well mate!"
The announcement of the Tesla Chinese gigafactory
No clue. The whole market seems down a bit today. Could just be because its a half day before Christmas and NIO is a volatile stock anyway.
Maybe tax losses
"Was an article out this morning about this not being an ""investment "" rather a gamble"
https://investorplace.com/2019/12/nio-stock-a-gamble-not-an-investment/
"Borrow data indicates pretty significant short selling the past two weeks. Also, short term investors likely exited and took profits this week to avoid holding during earnings."
It's because q3 financials are coming out and it might show a slight pull back. If nio was to deliver good news I believe they would of released the financials on time. Then again could be wrong.
Cheers for the link. Investorplace seem to make 2 articles a week bashing NIO though. Who knows. Merry Xmas
a new personal best for NIO. 1 day before Q4 ends. Q4 guidance better be 99.999% accurate.
Nice find!
"I‚Äôm honestly hoping for a pull back man.

My average is 1.5ish and I am kicking myself for only having a small number of shares."
"I suggest reduce your exposure, it will probably never be like Tesla. Nio hasn‚Äôt figured out mass production and battery production efficiency since its production is outsourced to gac motors."
"I am long NIO despite it not having a dynamic CEO like Elon.  I believe in the product and will take a risk.

I will say that NIO needs to figure out a way to build its own factory or simply merge with GAC in someway.

Charging infrastructure also needs to be addressed.(chicken and egg problem here)"
If they announce funding secure we all buying beerüëçü•≥
Long on Ni9.. But Mass model? Nioday should be a Suv coupe..??
"Yeah I know what u mean dude, I sold my BTC at a loss to double down on my position in Nio
But 1.5ish is amazing , congrats!"
"My speculation is: Nio day will be the day they announce the mass-model , and when the price is revealed to be a bargain, the stock will skyrocket purely on the ridiculously cheap price tag (in conjunction with a beautiful sedan model..)"
They actually didnt figure out production to begin with lol
Gas motors will no longer be a thing in China. NIO has the chance to be the Ford of China.
GAC just invested $1B :-)
"It just happened my friend, check twitter :-)
$1B secured
Fuck beer, let‚Äôs get 25 year single malt whiskeys"
"Yeah I saw the news on the SUV coupe but the teaser pics look like a Sedan. Maybe it‚Äôs somewhere in between but definitely more mass than high-end, and I‚Äôm pretty sure the price tag will be a jaw dropper"
I think this is a $7 stock. But severe cash crunch. Just like Tesla. Needs more hype.
"Gac motors http://www.gac-motor.com/ not gas Motors, lol"
"meh. they need their own factories. Doing more research, it looks like a company called WM Motors is ahead of all the other EV makers in China. It is still privately held but they already have factories built and sold 13K cars in 2019."
Ooooo baby!!! For sure I am!! Haha
üò∞
"I hear Elon is(how to say this nicely) HARD to work for(think Steve Jobs personality) so that is probably why Tesla has/had a lot of turnover.

I am long NIO despite it not having a dynamic CEO like Elon.  I believe in the product and will take a risk.

I will say that NIO needs to figure out a way to build its own factory or simply merge with GAC in someway.

Not sure yet. Most likely in chinese also.
Very exciting! Seems to be a good Q4.
YTD ?
My little stock that could
" 17,395 vehicles were delivered in 2019 as of November 30th"
My source https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-inc-provides-november-2019-080010793.html
"From CNN Money:

>Stock Price Forecast  
>  
>The 13 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Nio Inc have a median target of 14.36, with a high estimate of 89.08 and a low estimate of 6.41. The median estimate represents a +426.85% increase from the last price of 2.73.

While at the same time we have major move on options - Jan 17 $3 Calls Sweep (13) near the Ask: 1500 @ $0.141 vs. 94783 OI; Ref=$2.7
I agree totally thank you for sharing this üòâ
I wish I understood options but I really don't so I just hold
So basically someone offered huge amount of call options for sale. Which meaning this person is certain that NIO's price won't go above $3 by January 17th.
Oh then I  think they might be screwed üòâ
"I know, right? But it could be also someone on the inside. So what I am trying to say is - Keep your eyes open and don't give in for the hype"
"I'm starting to think in January =( We're running out of time for them to announce a December date. 

Q2 - Announced 20 days prior to release

Q1 - Announced 13 days prior to release

Q4 2018 - Announced 13 days prior to release"
"Hmmm. Thanks, hopefully soon."
Awesome!!! Let's go!
I'll pull as much info I can find on the CEO I found quite a bit but that was before I decided to start sharing on the Reddit page so ill compile some things I find together and share it tomorrow.
The app is definitely an advantage the eco is very active and I see so much more then these analysis are sharing I have quadrupled my position to over 2500 shares this is gonna be huge
"Most likely Mandarin since they are headquarters in Shanghai. Home of the mainland language.

Well... I'm pretty sure at the big institutions they have  analysts who understand Chinese and are solely brought into the company to focus on the auto sector as a whole or more specially concentrated on NIO. Investigating the ins and outs of the stock and picking as much dirt as possible in all the news outlet. Pretty sure they eat, breath, sleep about NIO. 

Parts of me would say that it's already priced into the stock just like the move we had today with the announcement award car of the year. But of course the market is irrational and driven by emotion ;)"
Stupid auto spell meant CEO not eco

Doesn't make any sense but **keep em coming!** Would love to know more about the NIO app since we can't get it in America.
You‚Äôre very welcome
"Yeah, the translator isn't that good üòÜ I'll keep them coming."
"May not be perfect, but it's a start"
How quickly get they get this into production?
"I thought it was going to be something like Tesla model y, but it seams like a seadan Tesla model 3."
What about the EP7?
I liked the ep7 but they are holding off on it for now. Unless this is it I don‚Äôt think this car is going to be named the 3rd model.
"Great, would have been better if they showed more of the driving experience.

It's like buying swim trunks and never going to wear them."
"More interesting will be to what extent they talk about their collaboration with Xpeng on Nio Day. Will it just be limited to charging stations, or will we see further integration of Chinese NEV companies in their vehicles and production, like General Motors, due to subsidy cuts, increased competition, and macroeconomic factors."
Sorry meant the 28th
I hope so we have all been waiting. üòë
I've heard there are over 100 ev companies in China but a lot of them don't release vehicles. soon subsidies will only go to certain producers of electric vehicles and when that happens alot will either close up shop or try to work for Tesla and Nio
"Will they release earnings before, on, or after that day? We will wait and see."
"I can see acquisitions, or collaborations happening over at Nio with those \~100 EV companies. For Tesla that would be unlikely. However, Elon and company will have a lot of talent to pick from once people hang up their hats.

With all that being said, I am excited for Nio Day. I hope they can get on track with disclosing financials. I am not sure how accurate CNN Forecast is but their report for Nio seems really good ([High is $89 a share](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=nio)). 

What do you think of this? Hopefully after the 28th that number won't seem delusional."
I saw that to i don't really trust cnn but i believe once nio really start pushing out cars like 15-20k  a quarter it will rocket. If anything i think its low üòÄ.  Even on the lowest end cnn is thinking $6 so at this price i think its a steal. This company is looking better and better the more i learn about it. Can't wait for the reveal! I think the price will push back a little investors might get spooked since its a new model and hasn't been market tested yet so I'm getting ready to load up.
"Are those based on trends you observed in other companies like Tesla? Did Tesla shares go up when they hit 15-20k/quarter, and similarly did they go down when the Cybertruck was announced? Would be an interesting case! And yeah, even if it's the lowest (\~$6), or at best the median (\~$14), that is a BIG win for Nio shareholders :D"
That would be neat if they could make it open source üòâ
It still can't speak English
For now I believe it will very soon
"Give them time, they'll eventually have English translation. Especially since there next market to sell their vehicles in the US/UK. We are playing the patient game."
"So about 18k for the year after Dec.

Why is the stock getting shit on?"
Old news like a week ago
I'm assuming market makers
They still haven't released Q3 earnings even though Q4 is almost over. That isn't a good sign.
">Why is the stock getting shit on?

The company does not make a profit yet. In fact, it should have run out of cash a few weeks ago unless a new investor came aboard."
Just trying to keep the Nio Reddit alive with the twitter posts I just saw it so shared it. üòâ
Q3 and Q4 will be good.  They tremendously delayed the bad Q2 so I ‚Äúthink‚Äù with a new CFO and a new ER to report they are seriously busy.
"Nio never has been quick to release earnings. I think its because they are a foreign company they can wait as long as they please. 

I think US companies  with large market caps need to report within 45 days. NIO.... hold my beer reports 84 days after the quarter ends."
"Q3 ended long ago so they have the data. Other than a bad Q3 to report, why delay their report so long?

Edit: I'm not sure why I got downvoted for asking a legitimate question which one has yet to answer. The NYSE has rules and if companies don't play by them, they get delisted."
They're still running I was reading for a while they would go bankrupt before the end of the year if they make it then ill stick with them.
Not received well from investors
UBS price NIO at 4
NIO will be the tesla of Asia
Smh
LOL üòÇ
"Yesterday we broke 2.5 for a while, and ate up the majority of that sell wall. Holding $2.5+ would be nice. As this would be the first time any of my Nio calls would be ITM. 

November sales were a bit of a disappointment, but I'm glad the market seems to like the numbers."
"So last night I was looking through the Trading 212 app as I do sometimes. I'm always curious about investing but haven't bit the bullet, I just look. 

Well anyway. I saw Nio and thought ""what the hell"", I bought a few shares. I don't expect it to make me a millionaire. I don't know much about Nio but I'm aware theyre a small output Chinese EV company? That's potential."
üòÜ guess I'll have to keep holding was up over $600 this morning now just neutral sucks keep waiting I guess I'm in at 2.24
I agree with the sales. This is also a company that was out for the count major headlines for the last few months that the company was ready for bankruptcy and wouldn't make it to the end of the year. I see them holding on and they seem to be improving. I think we are going to see $2.80 -$3 before the end of the year let's see.
They‚Äôre  doing big things and I try to share any news or tweets Nio releases to this reddit page if you bought under $2.50 I honk you‚Äôll be alright seems to want to break out past that number
"At least the delivery number didn't go down. Remained flat and given they said 3 months ago about opening new nio space, u can't expect within those 3 months to give you like 4000 delivery.. Maybe in the future given more time and they start settling in. I see this move as building the foundation."
Yeah I think I bought in at $2.49 or something?
Yup
Isn't the borrowing fee like 80% for 100k shares?
I have a feeling the volume hiked up today ahead of market closure bc of NASDAQ‚Äôs false ER date... Many people must‚Äôve thought their ER was today after-market.
"Short sale volume peaked the 14th then dropped to nominal volumes the past 2 weeks. Coincidentally, Nio‚Äôs share price has been steadily going up since the 14th. Nio‚Äôs borrow rate is at a 6 month all time high with little to no shares left to borrow.  I believe in Nio and I think they are going to knock Q4 out of the park, but I would bet money that the share price is going to drop like a rock following Q3 regardless of performance. I expect some extreme volatility mid to late December. Until then, I‚Äôm enjoying the ride."
Robinhood also has had the wrong earning date for weeks now. I go based on nios website now.
"I agree its nice to see the stock settle down. Helps with my selling of puts and calls. 

I do feel very bullish for Nio at this point. Q4 will be a big quarter. We car sale seasonality to help boost us this quarter. (China sells the most cars in Q4). 

I expect Nov sales to be better then Octobers sales."
"All I can see is that the smart money is keeping this stock in a consolidation mode and waiting for the ER report and the moment it comes up, get ready for the ride of your life.  With all this positive news we've seen recently, I'm pretty sure the CEO and all his executive members understand they can't screw up this ER call. Too much expectation is weighing on their shoulder. But regardless of the volatility coming from this stock, as long as there continues to be demands for their EVs, we'll be fine.  Stay strong my friends, be the strong hands.

Institutional ownership (buying & selling) - [https://fintel.io/so/us/nio](https://fintel.io/so/us/nio)"
"Future is definitely looking bright for EV and especially in China. Nasdaq posted that their next q3 ER is on Nov, 26. I‚Äôll be giving thanks to NIO this thanksgiving üìà"
"I wouldn't trust that, their's still nothing on Nio's IR site about the next earnings release. Generally you'd get at least a weeks notice from the announcement"
"Unfortunately, It‚Äôs not WHAT you know, but always WHO you know *winks*"
Word
"I think it will all get better once they start selling out of China... and if they‚Äôre successful inside, they will be everywhere. Like every other products made in China"
"Was doin some research and with the 2 consecutive months of increasing sales, some positive news might come out. 
October had only 3 weeks of sales and sold 2,526  vehicles.
That‚Äôs an average of 119 per day in October
November has 30 sales days, so if we use that 119 average number we get 3,570
Now as far as I know nio spaces are still being rolled out as we speak, so that 119 per day number is probably conservative. I would not be surprised if we get 3,500-4,000 deliveries for November. JAC motors capacity it 5,600 units per month."
"Don't be concerned about Tesla just yet. The SUV category is like 40% of the China auto market, and the model 3 is a sedan, which is about 31% of the market. SUV category is expected to grow to 51% by 2025. Apples and Oranges, if you went to the super market to buy an Apple would you leave the store with an orange instead? 

I expect the cash burn to be less then Q2, as they started a lot of cost cutting measures during the Q2, which wouldn't have impacted the balance sheet until Q3. Like layoffs, and selling the Formula E team. 

Q3 had the most deliveries for the year, so  we should be seeing better margin rates.  I'm thinking between -2-4% gross margins."
Interesting! I too am hopeful for a great November
"Eli5, what does this mean for Nio? With the analysts neutral rating at 2.50 initially, are we going to see a buying rating soon? 

What do you all think about this new CFO? Does he look credible? Can he make a turnaround story?  Does he have any affiliation with Tencent to take on this role? Why does he want to take this role?

So many unanswered questions."
"The only thing keeping it up last week was the battle of the options. Options Friday. Big money will come into play, to fight for a certain strike price to be valid. Last week was the $2 fight between puts and calls and puts won."
C'on NIO you can do it!
"I think the mistake people make it is, people think is doing great. But for the company to grown they really need to make profit.

Remember this company lose 4mil every single day.
They really need to think where is their strength and they need to make at-least 10k/mth, to just substantiate it self from bankrupt."
Im long in this. My avg is 2.6$. As far as i can see NIO is doing very good with partnership with mobileye and increasing deliveries by 25%. I dont see why anyone is willing so sell at so low price.
"No, for company to grow it is enough to increase sales and attach more attention from investors. NIO trades only two times their sales. Also this is Chinese company not American, they do things differently. They have a lot more money to support this kind of companies if they see it is worth it in the long run."
"The auto business is extremely difficult and I'm not convinced that Nio has the proper management and vision to succeed. I hope they do though as I want EVs to overtake ICE cars, I'm pro environment."
"It is only matter of time when EV will overtake ICE cars. And lets be fair, NIO makes the best EV's of all Chinese startups. Also they started a lot better then Tesla. All they need is more funding from China.inc"
They need a lot more funding and they need to focus on autos and not being a lifestyle company. That is concerning.
"They are EV company, lifestyle company is just a fasade to stand out. But i do agree that nio houses were a very bad idea."
"I do believe it will go below $1, the late news is just manipulation. How come single news intel collaboration can make it jump 60%. Doesn‚Äôt make sense."
how much debt are you in?
Two milkshakes ü•õ ü•õ
-11.32% as of right now.
"I don't understand why it jumped so much on this, they've been using mobile eye hardware for their Driver assistance technology. I'm guessing now they are sharing data with each other?"
The ol‚Äô pump n dump again
"Nope, they have a tendency to wait quite a while before reporting."
6 days before Q4 ends my **guess**.  Week of Dec 23rd
I recently started following this stock and been doing lots of research. It looks like they burned through over $5Bil and will need funding to survive. Can you express your opinion on long term investment for this stock. Thx
Thank you
"They burned through $3 billion, the headlines you‚Äôre reading are inaccurate.  I recommend you read their prospectus, annual report, and quarterly earnings to get a better perspective. 

It‚Äôs true, Nio certainly needs funding by the end of the year. However, they are well positioned in China as the leading domestic EV company. They already had a $1.5 billion framework agreement in the beginning of the year from E-Town Capital; it‚Äôs likely they will either close this deal or find another funding source. Based on the news we‚Äôve heard recently it would seem Nio is soliciting funds for joint ownership with their autonomous cars which would funnel into the parent company."
"This may not be a great comparison, but if you look at all of the hundreds of chinese/usa ev startups, NIO and Xpeng are the only two to have vehicles in production. Most of the others have admitted they don't have the money to put their car into production. So in that case, NIO is the best startup right now. They've been very quiet about their future funding, with possible investment from china, IPO in china, or other sources, nothing official yet."
Thank you for the info. Are you buy on this one? Currently any shares owned?
Stock price is up 28% at the time of writing. Let's fucking go!
"With a combination of October report delivers, this mobileye Intel partnership, with a bears covering their position, and then people outside running with FOMO, with momentum traders jumping in and now new bullievers, this can help justify the massive spikes in share

I would wait like the others say for their earning reports and see if you still believe in the company and wait for 10/15% drop to get back then. Only if you still believe."
"This is speculation news, it better to see the delivered car in q4 2019 and the expenses. In order to gain this price they need some funding to maintain the cash flow."
I believe!
Expecting it to hit 2.50 by Mid December *fingers crossed*
Then what was the reason for the CFO's departure....
"Hopefully, then I'd actually have a call that's in the money."
"> Disclosure: Author is short Nio

Anything this article says should be considered biased and taken with a grain of salt. The author is financially motivated for Nio‚Äôs share price to fall. Not sure why the moderators are allowing biased articles from Yahoo Finance to be posted here."
"Generally all the articles written on yahoo finances for Nio, have been written from Investor Place. Yes, many of these articles are bearish and bias."
That‚Äôs just standard operating procedure.
"Good point.

Though I agree that $NIO is in big trouble.

I will remain long until it goes bankrupt or makes their turnaround."
"I sold my 400 shares I bought at around $7.26 last month. Nio and their financing issues are ridiculous. Sadly, I think they‚Äôre going bankrupt, not even the chinese government is helping them anymore."
Bro im 25 in at $7..... Still holding.... I got nothing to lose.
"You should hold It, if bankrupt you lose $229, remember if this company went bankrupt. Temasek, Tencent, CEO and some China gov money Will be gone. I believe It Will going up perhaps not in this moment.

They Need to get additional funding, cut cost and improve the sale. Just don‚Äôt see this stock in 1-2 years and invest Little by Little."
"I bought shares when it was 10.11, those were the days üò™"
Average down so you‚Äôll be in profit when it goes back to $7.42. Stocks always go back up eventually.
"Damn bruh

Wait for it. When financing issues are resolved this will be 10 dollars

Buy more."
Your a big timer
"that's right. no reason to sell at current price. besides, seeing tesla's rise, chinese government might decide to bail nio so they could ride the wave of EVs"
so your saying that if they go bankrupt i still get some money back?
Don‚Äôt cut yourself on this falling knife. Cut losses and count it as a lesson.
What do you all think?
Bankruptcy soon.
"Tough to say. NIO has been somewhat quiet about what's happening financially. Whether their getting investment from e-town, or listing in shanghai, nobody really knows."
"NIO desperately needs more cash to burn. Production is ramping, es6 looks great, but financial situation is not looking good. I hope China Inc. will ballout it."
best meme ever.  Goodluck to us all.
hold strong ladies and gentleman
"I have been long since the beginning. I read the prospectus and annual report and I was convinced Nio was set up to become the next Tesla. In hindsight I should‚Äôve sold in February. When they canceled plans for their factory they had good reasons. Since then bashing has been non stop. It‚Äôs incredible all the things people will claim. I‚Äôve averaged down since then, holding 15k at $3.25. Historically the 4th quarter is strongest for Chinese auto companies. If Nio reports strong sales and new financing the stock should shoot up. And shorts are paying 40%+ in fees just to hold their short. It‚Äôs a pretty quality set up at these prices, the risk/reward is good."
I still bullish on this at 15k shares at 1.76$. The probelm is have to get most the information from china sources. But this new SUV joint Venture coming to the market OCT 22nd sounds promising. They still need a factory and money. Gac/NIO suv coming soon
"I have owned the stock but don't now. I've followed it since pre IPO. I have no idea if it will succeed or not. I don't see it becoming a Tesla because they are not dialed into the technology needed to adequately bring down the battery costs to a point where it's less than ICE. That said, I don't think the business model is horrible; it's very unorthodox, but it does make sense in a way. If the company weren't so stuck on building out a bunch of ancillary and unnecessary things like House, app, etc, then I would be more optimisitc."
"I have 6,000 @3.40  I‚Äôm basically forced to stay long."
"Thanks for the responses.

I did plenty of digging and decided to open a long position."
"With 53% institutional owner ship, I got to believe that the market makers crashed nio so that they can get cheap shares, then they'll pump it back up to $15 like we had it after the 60 mins interview."
"This company will not survive the coming recession, there is absolutely no chance."
">When they canceled plans for their factory they had good reasons.

What were the reasons?"
Hope today‚Äôs surge is a trend reversal
"The recession aren‚Äôt coming till the DOW hits 30,000.  Daily 290 point moves are normal it‚Äôs just 10%.  The inverted yield curve however is a strong sign it‚Äôs coming but not telling us when"
"Nio had framework agreements for a factory in Shanghai that were scrapped due to Tesla‚Äôs gigafactory in the same area. According to Nio they are rewarded by the Chinese government for joint manufacturing, so maybe joint manufacturing with JAC isn‚Äôt such a bad thing. I consider it to also be a good financial move, Nio certainly was not in the place to invest a large capital expenditure in a factory earlier this year. I‚Äôm optimistic about the future though because they‚Äôre seeking financing to have their own factory to build their ‚Äúnext gen‚Äù cars like the ET7, which is where all this R&D has been going."
There are many more signs of what is to come besides the normal price fluctuations. Ex) Quantitative Easing is back. You can only prop up an economy in fake money for so long before it comes collapsing down.
"Thanks for the response.

I still think NIO has a little lower to go but will ultimately reward folks who stay for the long haul."
I think we have least 4 years.  That's just like my opinion man.
NIO will not hurt me anymore. I will not allow it.
"Nio:
Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me."
"Still a may. If it doesn't happen, looks like we can drop another 10% lol"
They need a factory more sooner then later. They bleeding money right now.
Up 8% at time of writing. About fucking time. Hopefully this is the beginning of its recovery. Let's go!
"It‚Äôs downhill from here, their hope was Nio house will make them money which didn‚Äôt work out. There is no company which outsourced its manufacturing at beginning stage and succeeded."
Another pump and dump? I'm kidding.
You got it right!
Yes
All we need is to get another 60 mins special and its back to $13.
"All IPOs have a price crash while they are in growth mode, perfectly normal, this is an amazing buying opportunity. Just look at how many stores they are opening."
No
This week Will be less than $1
"No way Nio survives 2020 recession, nobody is going to give them money to stay alive when they‚Äôre already almost dead."
"No, company doesn‚Äôt even produce their own cars. They haven‚Äôt solved the battery production in scale. CEO of company doesn‚Äôt seem knowledgeable and missing on key details. Mostly seems like gimmicky company. All the executives are leaving. Run away from the company. It seems like company created by big oil (or short sellers) to confuse people by comparing it with Tesla and creating click and bait news headlines like ‚ÄúNIO is failure, next is Tesla‚Äù. NIO and Tesla has no comparison, none zero.
Also I don‚Äôt see many Nio reviews on YouTube by real users makes me think something not right."
"Hard to say. At this point NIO survival depends on  continues support from CCP and tencent. Im long, so i dont really care. Every company you ever invest in might fill article 11. It is just unavoidable risk you need to take. Im in this with 5k shares at 3.5 avg."
Care to elaborate?
"Dear Mr. Musk, 
Please buy NIO (or at least buy a 20% share) and expand your empire. They‚Äôve slashed prices just for you. This sale is for a limited time only."
YouTube is blocked in China. So your not going to find any videos
Best of luck to us then.
"They have significant investment from both Chinas major electronic companies, and indirect investment from the Chinese government."
Please don't - focus on Tesla. Mr alibaba could bail them out hough...
"Tesla should send a guy to be their ceo, then they can be healthy competitors for the common good"
Do you have any sources to back this? It‚Äôs hard to find information on NIO.
Problem is that the Chinese government making further investments might end up completely wiping out existing shareholders.
It might be 18 months.  They are both correct.  I think out of a top 10 EV's the gov chose to back NIO. This is awful though.  I'm hurting so bad.
"This does not look good at all! Basically they seem to found another big drain for all the money they were going to save from all the cost cutting measures! I really hope their sales rebound. Hopefully Tesla's popularity would give them some exposure too, and their sales would pick up."
"I knew I bought 2,000 more shares on Friday for a reason.  Hopefully I can sleep at the NIO house if I show them my negative returns I got in 5 months"
"Chinese culture is completely different than American/Western culture. I have a feeling they like this sort of thing otherwise it wouldn't make much sense.  I think they should have stronger branding to be more competitive, especially at these NIO houses."
These Nio Houses are not a good investment for the company.
"They don't plan on opening any more Houses, they are instead shifting to NIO Places."
How about focus on cars
It's Nio Spaces. Basically like your Tesla mall shop. Can't sell cars without stores.
"nio Space, Places, Houses, apps, classes... wtf are they doing.... build cars dammit!"

"Here's the webcast.
https://ir.nio.com/news-events/events/event-details/nio-inc-second-quarter-2019-earnings-conference-call"
"Oh boy, NIO has tanked hard. So glad I bailed on this stock when it peaked in March."
"They are quite aware they have 500m in cash and spend around 4m a day. The next 3 months will be interesting to see.

#notabearorbull"
"Yeah, it is but reassuring that li bin and tencent put more of their own money. In the long term I think they will be okay, but I am not sure how long is the long term here. And I looked at their earnings report, for some reason there's no mention of 1.45$ billion funding. Did they something about it in the earnings call?
Also, I was looking at tesla model s numbera from 2012 and they look somewhat better. But that could be attributed to US versus china and that there is more competition now for nio."
"Lol I was almost thinking of that. But, I think I am going to hold. The main question for me was, are they going to go bankrupt? Given that they are one of the few companies that have cars on the road, many funding agencies would come out to support them. And it looks like they already have the support from tencent and Beijing government. So, I am thinking of holding on to it for little more."
"Thank you! But I knew where to find it, but I haven't had time to sit down and listen to it. So., I was just wondering if someone spent time to listen to all of it and if li bin said some reassuring things for the investors.
I"
They shouldn't go bankrupt. They claimed the reason they canceled they earning call was because of ongoing talks in regards to NIO China. Could this potentially mean some major change in ownership or IPO in China?
"They plan to stop building NIO Houses and let their leases expire after 3 to 5 years. Instead they want to build a bunch of NIO Places which seem more like regular smaller stores. They also want to continue optimizing their workforce through the rest of the year and sell off some non core assets.
They anticipate to continue to reduce battery costs and work with suppliers to reduce part costs with rising production.
They also are launching a new leasing service and are working for more fleet sales.
They additionally have a bunch of new partnerships with Chinese banks for financing."
"Just saw this. They also clarified on the gross margin for Q3. As they mentioned NIO space cost a fraction of NIO house, its cost is based on sales as well. It is a matter of whether those NIO space can bring in a big enough increase in sales to lower down the average cost for each car. From ES8 and ES6 data, the 0% margin point is somewhere near 8k cars per quarter. However, the company also says the margin in Q3 will be lower due to the delivery of lower price models. Hope that helps with a better idea on the company when next month ( last month of Q3 ) delivery numbers comes out."

[deleted]
Thank you for this :)
That won't happen.
"Yeah, I would agree! Nio had a massive chance of selling their cars in big numbers before tesla's GF3 started production. I really expected Nio to be hitting 10000 cars per quarter, after 8000 in the 4th quarter last year.
I think, they can deal with every problem, if they are able to sell their cars. They need to sell cars and sell them in big numbers. Hopefully fleet sales would be helpful if they can manage that."
No earnings call?
Some poo poo
[deleted]
yikes
[deleted]
Good luck. I'm curious to know how it goes for you. I don't own the stock but had hoped the company would succeed as I want EVs to succeed.
They said it was cancelled due to ongoing discussions in regards to NIO China.
[deleted]
"I like the product. What I don't like is that they are doing things that don't seem to add much business value, like the ""Nio House"". Seems like a big cost and not much of a revenue generator. I don't like that the CEO doesn't have an engineering background. He wants to create a ""lifestyle"" brand. I just don't see that panning out long term. I also don't like the battery swap model, it seems like something that could be a can of worms."
"Great Video!! I actually owned this stock before and got out at $9.5 before it crashed backed down. One of the interesting things about this company is that they abandoned there plans to build their own manufacturing plant and continue to outsource. However, u should have mentioned the NIO ep9."
"My biggest argument for buying Nio right now is total shareholder investment is $3.5 billion, and as of right now (9/23) their market cap is $3 billion. That means new investors can purchase equity at potentially a lower price than early investors like Tencent and Hillhouse.  Nio has all the makings of a strong company; arguably their stock is undervalued."
"VIDEO IS FROM  May 29, 2019"
TL; DW?
"Is not the right time, this quarter they use to repair 4K car battery issue, and they only deliver 2.8k es6. By right is burning some $, and the stock should below $2. Wait until they able to sell consistent number of cars."
Please explain your thinking about the stock being undervalued.
"Tl;DW = Nio is a speculative stock with no profits but given the low price, it may be worth the risk now(vs buying in during the IPO around $10)"
Everyone values companies differently but NPV analysis estimates shareholder equity to be around $5.1 billion. At a minimum I believe equity to be worth what the original shareholders put into it unless the company is insolvent which it is not.
Jesus I'm glad I didnt buy in yesterday...
"But, one of the concerns in these numbers is, es8 numbers are down. ES6 clearly seems to be having an effect on es8 sales."
"They‚Äôre built on the same platform so it‚Äôs no sweat off Nio‚Äôs back if one sells more. The reason this is great news is because it means customers are adopting and accepting the Nio brand. Cannibalization was expected, and it‚Äôs no different from other companies like BMW selling both the X3 and X5."
"Oh, that's a good point! Thanks!"
"Only thing I‚Äôm buying is PUTS! 

I lost a substantial amount of money watching this thing tank the last few months and if I can recoup some of it by betting against it, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do."
It's time to sell puts!!!
"In the meantime, remember that it is only a loss on paper.  It is not realized until you sell.  

You might as well be patient, hold, and see if they can recover now."
You are playing it wrong. You should have been buying puts all this time. Now its time to buy calls.
How are those calls working out for you?
This chat is as dead as the NIO stock ... keep downvoting
"Hindsight is great isn‚Äôt it? 

I‚Äôve been buying puts for 3 months"
"Didn‚Äôt buy calls. However, i bought the shares. Well not good but its going to be a long term hold anyways"

> Tencent-backed EV startup NIO is laying off 62 employees from its Silicon Valley office in San Jose, California, according to a new filing with the state&#039;s Employment Development Department.

> It&#039;s the Chinese company&#039;s second round of cuts in the US this year, as NIO laid off 70 employees and closed a San Francisco office back in May. NIO began 2019 with 640 employees in Silicon Valley, according to financial filings.

> Deliveries of the ES6 began in June, and NIO says it has 12,000 preorders for the newer SUV. Regardless, NIO is most likely going to miss its target of delivering 40,000 vehicles in 2019.

"Numbers look good, it looks like Nio has secured a solid market share of 2-5% of Chinese BEV‚Äôs."
Blue Sky Coming
I believe they are convertable to 2.98 for 1 year notes and 3.12 for the 3 year notes.
If I knew what that word meant
"They convert into either the cash value or one share. So you can take the $2.98, but if Nio shares are worth more you can convert to a share of Nio and sell that share.  If Nio is worth $10 you would make $7.02 plus the annual coupon rate."
"If it‚Äôs $1 a note holder still gets $2.98,  is that the logic.  Ensuring a 2% return which is much more than a bank......"
This is some Elon level devotion. CEO putting up 100 million.
They should invest in a dedicated charging network(like Tesla did)
"They did, it‚Äôs been spun off as a separate company: Nio Power.  https://equalocean.com/auto/20190716-exclusive-nio-seeks-funding-for-nio-power"
Hmmm interesting. A separate company by itself or a subsidiary company of Nio?
"It‚Äôs complicated but I think it‚Äôs owned by Nio. You can find the ownership relationships in the [prospectus](https://imgur.com/a/BFM3QPr).  Excuse my screenshot, I‚Äôm on mobile."

Thank You
Everyone here seems to care only about the stock. Does not bode well for the company.
Aren't they related though? They will need large amounts of money going forward. Higher stock price means that they can raise money relatively easily.
"I mean they wont make it if people don't care about their cars enough. People love Tesla cars - thats what makes them succesfull.   


But pump and dump I guess..."
I think people will become more excited once the ET7 car is released(next year?)
The theory is they are waiting for August sale numbers before releasing ER. My expectation is between September 4th and the 6th. If they wait until the 9th I‚Äôll be disappointed.
Pretty upsetting how late we are in the cycle and don't have Q2 earnings yet. They definitely want August deliveries to offer some good news
I don't believe there's any official date yet.
Trumpet needs to stop making so much noise & cancel the tariffs.  It‚Äôs concerning that NIO could be successful but the China market could crash.
"Just 2 days untill the 6th. One rumor was earnings today, but that didn't happen."
Aug + July are 3rd Qtr so this must be bad
"Probably, we saw some drastic financial moves for the 3rd quarter: layoffs (reduced expenses) and finalization of the E-Town Capital investment (cash-flow). The constant articles from Investor Place are right somewhat, Nio has a short term cash flow problem. The 2nd Qtr ER is going to reflect that big time. Nio may be softening the blow with positive delivery results for August. The good thing is performance for Nio is expected to improve drastically given the cyclical nature of Chinese auto sales. We should see positive guidance for the 3rd and 4th quarter which hopefully will improve investor confidence."
What are the white dots?
"Great post, do you have a source for the graphic?"
"i think the refresh dates.

Formula E got refreshes every year for the race."
That's what I thought too but figured every 3 years was too often.
"may be its for their second gen platforme.

ET7 will be the first to use it."
Good point. ET7 comes in 2022? I just noticed it wasn't on here.
yes according to chinapev.com the ET7 will be the first to use the 2nd gen platforme in 2022.
Nio is fraud.
"Retiring, but will stay in touch as an advisor"
"That's a strange one!!! I wonder if they'll have some cool RGB lighting in the cabin, and a high refresh rate monitor."
What? They already a company.  I don‚Äôt understand the verbiage & does this mean they will be on their own stock market? The Nikkei???
"Instead I‚Äôm a bag holder at $4 and stuck on the fence.  

The EP9 I think they made 11 and sold them and now they are going to make 11 more and sell them for a little over $1M"
Seems like the NIO ES8 is a safe car. Good to know NIO is has teams testing against other standards besides China's.
I talked (emailed) two people in Ningbo China.  One said NIO or Weilai is not popular.  The other said NIO is the real deal.  I don‚Äôt know how long to hold the stock.  I predict it trades between $3-$5 for several years.  But I hope it jumps up.
TSLA just missed earnings so NIO is going to go down with it for the next couple days.
"Never buy stocks in chinese companies - they do not work like western companies. Who is the real owner?

Hope they make it and create great cars though!"
"Interesting. Good question- who?

I played around w/ Nio months ago. I don't like that they focus a lot on these ""nio houses"". Too much expense"
They have massive losses yet have money to fund other companies? I don't get it
And then the share price dropped.
I‚Äôve been through a lot with NIO stock. It looks like a pump and dump because the only thing that made it rise this much is Tesla saw an increase in demand. I won‚Äôt touch it until earnings just my opinion.
"Part of it is Chinese car sales (ICE + EV) have increased for the first time in 12 months. 

 [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-08/china-car-sales-rise-for-first-time-in-year-helped-by-discounts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-08/china-car-sales-rise-for-first-time-in-year-helped-by-discounts) 

&#x200B;

Second, some shorts are covering, short interest has decreased by 12% about.

&#x200B;

Third, speculation on Q2 sales exceeding guidance. 

&#x200B;

Fourth, you can make more money by pumping this now, then you can short it. Like it was at 2.38 for a low. It could only go down another 2.38. Whereas you can pump it back up to IPO range of $6 and make nearly 3X more money."
I am wondering the same thing. Very hard to get info on Nio here in the states.
I'm short 3.51
Increase in tesla demand
That makes a lot of sense. Thanks!
"For about two years, the Nio EP9 sports car prototype had the fastest lap time of any electric vehicle on the grueling Nuerburgring Nordschleife at 6:45.90. Although the EP9's record fell last month to the Volkswagen IDR, the result proved that Nio's innovative technology could compete with the world's best. Nio founder and CEO William Li spoke to¬†Automotive News Europe¬†Correspondent Christiaan Hetzner during the Shanghai auto show about the EV maker's plans for Europe, competing with German rivals in China and the need for fresh funding after listing on the New York Stock Exchange.   


**The best chance for a Chinese automaker to break into the European market is with EVs. Does Europe appeal to you?**

Yes. We want to be a global brand. We have almost 200 people in Munich, for example. But we are still a very young company and have limited resources. If we expand abroad, we should be profitable. That's why we should be very careful when we expand outside of China because it's very easy to enter a market, but very hard to survive and win.  

**German brands dominate the Chinese premium car market. How can Nio break though?**  

We just entered the segment with a vehicle that is not cheap, it [the ES8] costs about $75,000. As a competitor to the Audi Q7 seven-seat premium large SUV, we have a market share of more than 10 percent, and that is just the beginning.

**Do you see the German automakers as dinosaurs that are too slow to react to new trends?**  

They are powerful, have lots of money and they are already changing. So while they may be giants, I do not see them as moving slowly. As a startup, however, we need to move faster.  

**You showed the ET Preview concept sedan at the Shanghai auto show in April. When will this Tesla Model 3 rival debut?**  

That was just to show the car's styling. We will gather the feedback and then decide when and how to launch a sedan in that segment.

**What's next for Nio?**  

We have started delivering the ES6 SUV that competes with the Audi Q5, BMW X3 and Mercedes GLC. Our performance is better, our service is better, maintenance and operating costs are lower and charging is much more affordable than filling up with gasoline. Not only that, the license plate is free [in Chinese cities such as Beijing the plate can cost more than the vehicle] and you don't need to leave it at home one day out of the workweek [to comply with driving restrictions in China to reduce air pollution]."
"""We just entered the segment with a vehicle that is not cheap, it [the ES8] costs about $75,000. As a **competitor to the Audi Q7 seven-seat premium large SUV, we have a market share of more than 10 percent**, and that is just the beginning.""

Whoa, 10% marker share for a seven seat premium large SUV?"
"Yeah, I think what he meant was 10% market share in premium large electric suv. There is no way they have 10% market share of premium large suvs by selling 1000 cars per month."
That is 3 ES6 Models. The title makes it sound like NIO is giving away 3 real cars.
"Thank you for clearing that up. I can't believe I retweeted that thinking, oohh I may win a real car. It was really funny because in my head I was going ""geez they don't even sell in US, how would they even get the car to me if I won it."" and then I went ""Just going to retweet and if I win it I will think about it later"""
"Yeah, I thought the exact same thing. I was trying to find some terms that said you had to be in China or something. Then I realized its just the model, makes a lot more sense, still pretty cool."
only need 60% to brake even :_)
Haha i feel your pain
"im long term on this, so i dont really care, even bought 800 more stocks today.  3500 stocks in total."

"$8.4 I was stupid and sold $10 puts but that premium was too jucy not to, if only this didn't crash so hard"
6000 @ $4.5
"~1.8K @ 3.45
870 @ 6.2

Less than 5% of my AMD. Not worried at all."
What is this ? You‚Äôre forecasting out to 2038?
Can you redo this using 5 or less assumptions.  That margin rate of 15% is useless.  Consumer kickback in China has gone from $75k to $25k.  Car prices are either going up or margins will be less.
"Based upon that NPV cashflow, why not wait until 2022, when you estimate they'll start to turn a sustainable profit? Whatever small profit you lose by a higher entry point, should be outweighed by the opportunity cost of having to wait 3 years for it to happen."
thanks!!
"Keep convincing yourself that this company is anything other than a bad investment . Everyday the stock sinks further and further, prove me wrong."
NPV can be forecasted to infinity but it‚Äôs more appropriate to pick a timeline like 10 or 20 years. I chose 20 years since we can (a) reasonably estimate car sales for that long and (b) the company is in its infancy. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value
"From Citron's analysis:

>NIO management has forecast long-term goals of 23-25% gross margins and 10-12% operating margins, which seem very achievable especially considering Tesla‚Äôs recent disclosure that the Model S and X gross margins have now eclipsed 30%. 

I believe an average 15% margin to be a reasonable long term estimate.  

You need to make some assumptions in order to estimate future sales and revenue.  What assumptions would you make?"
Give it 5 year's? AMD was like $4 in 2011
"I don‚Äôt know.  I just think you have a lot.  I‚Äôm holding at $4.35

I would assume margins get thinner over the next 1 yr"
"Perhaps.  Louis T. Hsieh, NIO‚Äôs chief financial officer specifically commented: 

>‚ÄúLooking ahead to the second quarter, we expect an even more challenging sales environment and anticipate overall sequential demand and deliveries to decrease, as competition continues to accelerate and the general automobile market in China remains muted. Against this backdrop, NIO is focusing on rolling out our ES6 nationwide, and at the same time, improving overall network utilization and operating efficiencies.‚Äù

We may see improvements on operating efficiencies in the next year which should improve gross margin.  

Also, the automobile market in China is highly cyclical, therefore we can expect Nio's best quarter to be Q4.  It's also the first quarter that Wall Street can compare Nio to it's past performance and estimate future growth.  Vehicle margin in Q4, 2018 was 3.7%.  I think with their new ES6 Nio is well positioned to exceed last year's  vehicle margin."
Yeah comparing Q4 to Q1 is bias to write an underperform article
üòÄ
"Not sure, however I came upon this and thought it interesting. There‚Äôs a mention of NIO.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-warburg-pincus-china-fund/warburg-pincus-nearing-close-of-4-3-billion-china-southeast-asia-fund-sources-idUSKCN1T70L8"
"The CEO just did a Bloomberg video interview.

https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/video/investors-dont-understand-nios-long-220732181.html?soc_src=community&soc_trk=tw"
"Same, I got in a little higher at 4.8:/ but I have confidence, the longer term fundamental outlook is looking good as long as the Chinese government continues to help the ev industry and implement fiscal policies to increase demand . Although , for the short term it it‚Äôs looking good as there is no support , although there seems to be some resistance along the 2.5$ mark"
"Thank you.  Their sales look like Tesla units sold in 2014?? Am I missing something.  We are people buying puts at $0.65 and $0.84 according to the S.Alpha article posted today?  The entire article seems skewed because it complies Q4 to Q1 and just dug into how NIO be able to survive.  

Just upset.  Been holding since $4 and I‚Äôm outta gas"
"Just be glad you aren't holding from $10. IMO, I wouldn't be worried about a $4 entry if you have time to wait it out."
"I wish that I could understand the basic fundamentals, I‚Äôm just scratching my head.
https://www.nio.com/en_DE/about"
"If you are a long on NIO, sooner or later it will start making some decent profit. If you want a driver licence either you wait for years for government approval or buy EV."
"Do you know how long after Tesla was founded before they deliveted Model S?

NIO is executing at much faster pace"
"And therein lies the difference: Tesla had the right intangibles to scale at a rapid pace and cause investors to overlook its financial shortcomings.

A true visionary CEO people hailed and wanted to support; a car that at the time offered cutting edge technology, appealed to the social responsibility of consumers for adopting a zero emissions vehicle.

By the time the model S came out, there was MAJOR pent up demand.  Thousands of people sent deposits a year in advance, people waited.  It was cool to have one.

None of these things are true for Nio‚Äôs story.  I‚Äôm sorry to break that to you.  The CEO is not cut from the same cloth as Elon.  Nio is copying other companies and not innovating.  Nio isn‚Äôt even a factor in Level 5 autonomy.  It‚Äôs technology is well behind Tesla and other players who have already amassed real world autonomous driving miles.  They have no moat in a hyper-competitive space.  All they really did is burn a ton in SG&A and costs related to their NIO houses. It hasn‚Äôt gotten them anywhere.

I‚Äôll say it again for you.  **THERE IS NO DEMAND FOR NIO VEHICLES**.  They will never have their own factory because they will never be selling 100k+ cars a year.  They are struggling to hit 3000 deliveries per quarter of the ES8.  If they sell 50% more ES6 vehicles than ES8, but at the same time ES6 sales cannibalize 20% of ES8 sales, you are left with approximately 7000 cars sold in a quarter.

That‚Äôs maybe 28000 in a year, which would be impressive for them but in no way can move the needle whatsoever. That will cap them at about 1.2-1.5 billion in revenue for a year.  Of which they are probably lucky to see 10-15% of that in margin.

They are done, like I said look at their cash burn.  Who is going to keep throwing money at this?  They will at least need another dilutive offering, or to take on massive debt that will cost them a ton of money.

If you are holding you are betting on at least one of these things occurring:

- a surge in demand, which as of now looks highly unlikely given that at best they can hope for about 7000 cars delivered per quarter.

- massive help from the Chinese government, which as of now has not done a thing to truly help them out (in fact the lifting of EV subsidies hurt them)"
"LOL.  This is a joke right?

Elon Musk worst CEO put there.  Who the hell would want to emulate him?

You need to mire research bro.  Almost everything you posted is false"
"Address my points faggot.

Is that seriously your idea of a counterargument? I never said Musk was a great CEO, but he is absolutely a great visionary.  Early stages investors buy into the vision, always.  How many bags are you holding exactly?"
Dont want to waste my time.  But almost everything you posted is false and a lot is opinion
[removed]
"Heres some advice.  If you want people to engage in debate w you try using manners.

Bye!"
Post contained disrespectful and/or suggested violence.
"Boohoo grab your ball pack it up and go home because I didn‚Äôt use manners.  Great excuse.

You can‚Äôt even construct a counter argument to anything I said"
"Tesla and Nio fan here, acting like that towards people is just giving the Tesla community an image for being toxic. Tesla wants competitors, Nio is aiming to be one. The goal is for EVs to be the standard."
Basically to sum you up. Sell NIO cause im a short seller. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. No wonder Musk hates short sellers. They are all POS.
"my average price in NIO is about 4. All i can say that the short interest is way above what is normal, so short term short squeeze potential is big if it starts moving the other way, so price points like 5-7 are not out of the question. If the bears maintain firm grip on this i think this might eventually reach 2. I dont see much downside risk at this price point. For Long term is hard to say, cause it all depends on how good NIO actually is in making and selling cars. If we compare to Tesla, NIO started a lot better. So if it ever reaches the high of where Tesla is at this moment i think we should expect double or triple digits in the near 5-7 years."
For the sake of my investments I hope so
"Yes, in a big way.  Back to $7 then $10 is not far fetched"
Have you seen a car in real life? Not until than happens.
fax
bet
definitely not
"You mean in USA? The car is available in China and both ES6 and ES8 can be test driven now. The Facebook group has some people who have seen, driven, and owned the ES8.
Also, the ES8 has been seen testing near NIOs California HQ for over a year now. Thise don't make too many appearances though."
Why ?
Seen a picture in real life or a youtubevideo from an owner?
Yes lots
"Please send me a link, I can‚Äôt find any videos."
https://youtu.be/sskjvO9CnLM
"Always something, thanks - but not from an owner."
I realize the article doesn‚Äôt imply this but all I can think of is a non serviceable disposable electric car. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll help the climate change issue.

This guy obviously Robinhood‚Äôs and doesn‚Äôt do actual research
What‚Äôs wrong with Robinhood you got another service that lets you trade completely free?
"Robinhood is fine for the novice trader looking to get his feet wet. 

But as I said, do your own research on stocks and don‚Äôt trust what an app tells you."
Ok don‚Äôt listen to the app and do your own research and boom you now have free trading tool that you ignore. What‚Äôs better than that? You just can‚Äôt short stocks
When can I buy in the USA?
"Wow! Heres a link to an interview with Li.
https://www.autonews.com/shanghai-auto-show/nio-teases-upcoming-sedan-et-preview"
"The ET Preview is quite nice looking, although I think the lights could be more consistent with the ES8 and ES6.

[Carscoops](https://www.carscoops.com/2019/04/nio-et-preview-heralds-tesla-model-3-rival-with-317-mile-range/#lg=1&slide=1) has a lot more photos too."
Not available in the US yet. I believe they do plan on coming over to US eventually
I hope so
Am I understanding this correctly in that they are trying to create an open source EV platform?
"The facebook group is active. We just need to post more news and updates and discussion. NIO is only in China right now, so theirs not much visibility."
"Okay, I'm just noticing Nio information isn't getting here. The mod is non-existent."
Yeah not sure whats up with the mod here. We should try to get him replaced.
"Apparently this is the rumored EP7 car. I thought this would have been revealed at NIO Day 2019, but it's nice to have a preview at the Shanghai Auto Show."
">carscoops.com/2019/0...

Actually it may called ET7. and may be the concept one will show at the Shanghai Auto Show."
"I think everyone here is excited about Nio. I'm actually not concerned about the decision to move away from building their own factory for now. But they need to prove they can take on the market outside of China, that they have the safety and reliability that we expect from other manufacturers. I also suspect they are going to run into information privacy issues outside of China."
Anybody know what the deal with XPT is? I know they are founded by NIOs founder and produce all the components for NIO vehicles. Why are they made by XPT and not NIO?
My guess would be he has a larger share in XPT and there is good profitability in it for him. Similar to how McDonald's owns Martin Brower (their exclusive logistics partner).
"There aren't many overviews in English, so this was a good find.

I don't think he knew about the second row seats moving though. I am hoping that with adequate adjustment, the third row should be accessible and not as cramped as shown in the video."
This and the new 6 seat configuration that just launched. It looks like the first person with 6 seats took delivery a couple days ago.
You should try reddit request
I wouldn't say it's grown quick we are at 202 subs. But yes some more mods are needed
Did you PM him your GPU?
"You need to make a subreddit with a similar name r/NioCars or something like that, post a link to it on this sub and talk about how the Nio community on reddit is growing, and needs mods and how this community lacks them."
Rickey has been trying for months to get a new header but no response.
Wonder why no demand.
I'm thinking Pre-Order culture is not the same in China compared to North America. It's also tough since it's a Chinese brand and Tesla has availability with Model X. (+for being foreign) It's going to be hard to judge success until they actually have more ES8 in market and selling a few units to generate brand awareness... China's auto OEM's today is like KIA or Hyundai in the 90's. I would give them 5 years to build up brand reputation. They also need to expand in to developed markets with ES8 and ES6 
Something I wasn't expecting: They've terminated their plan for a NIO manufacturing plant in Shanghai and will instead focus on a joint manufacturing model into the long term.
Guess I'm bag holding
I have only 200 dollars in nio because I‚Äôm not an idiot - but has anyone here actually seen a real car or a video from a real owner?
"Missed a $250 profit, but gained $15 on a stop loss. Got to collect profits when you can while trading. -25% in 2 days. Did not see that "

Sorry...... 
"They already said they beat delivery guidance in the 4th quarter, margins improved significantly in Q3, I see no reason why margins wouldn't continue to improve in Q4."
Unless their spending got out of control?
Not totally wrong here. Outlook & 2019 deliveries are what's trash
Do you think they could have spent too much on market and would miss margins?
"Playing the market, even if they bear earnings and have great guidance, it could go down. Stock market is cooky right now. "
Excited to see them!

"This is probably in reference to [this news article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-31/china-s-nio-causes-traffic-chaos-after-car-shuts-down-on-road) about an over-the-air update being applied to a car on the road.

I have my doubts if this was a marketing move. It is drawing some negative attention, and some are questioning whether NIO had the right controls in place in their in-car software."
"If they treat it like they treated the Tesla, this could be bad for Nio fans "
Hopefully this will give Nio brand recognition outside of China.
Sign me up for a few laps!
Yeeessss
Though keep in mind that was over 10 years ago. Things have improved since then. They will likely treat it like the other electric supercars they reviewed before.
One can hope 
"Interesting that NIO doesn't have an emergency door latch like on the model 3. My guess is that would be required in usa, i know china has less regulation."
I hope that the windows would still work
I would buy one if it came to the USA
"In short yes, if they‚Äôre able to keep production costs lower then Tesla."
"They will come to the US. That's why they IPO in the US. It was in their filling that they intend to come to market in the US. Specifically they are aiming for 2020 

Europe, I haven't heard anything about that."
"I think if they compete on safety and are coming in at half the price of Tesla, I think they have the potential to do very well in North America. I don't think Nio Houses would work here, but I could be wrong.

Seems to be quite the diplomatic spat going on between Canada and China in regards to Huawei, so who knows how that will play out."
"They said usa 2020/2021. They have pretty significant offices here in us. I git the impression that this 2020 usa vehicle will be made explicitly for the us, so maybe not only sold outside china. Anyone know if they plan another manufacturing plant in the us or just use the china one their building now?"
"They were advertising on public transport at the auto show in Detroit, so I‚Äôd assume they have a plan to. "
"Would expect NIO to start sales in Europe 2020, 2021 latest. They have a design branch in M√ºnich already and the European governments are heavily giving incentives for EV buyers. At the moment it's a sellers market for electric cars in Europe; would be odd for NIO not to take advantage of it. 

I just today sat in an ES-8 (there was an event held in Norway) and all the people were all over that car. Will succeed when released to the market, for sure."
I‚Äôve tried to pre-order. Waiting for the day they‚Äôre available in the US
"It looks like it has a bigger crumple zone when compared to ICE cars, so that should improve the safety rating.  The biggest concern I've seen with Chinese cars \*trying\* to get into the US market is safety. If NIO can be nearly as safe as TSLA vehicles they'll have a good chance to overcome that negative bias. "
Nextev? Why dies it have old nio branding? If anything shouldn't it say XPT?
Yeah. Most cars from large chinese car companies like Geely get decent safety ratings.
Has anyone seen a nio? Cant find any real reviges on youtube...
"Good question, I have not. If everyone here wants to pay for my trip to China, I will gladly take on this task."
"Theirs a few, just none in English. Is youtube used and popular in China?"
No its banned but yes its popular.
Saw this yesterday and had a laugh.
"11,348 more than Faraday Future."
More positive news. Should be a good quarter. I'm looking forward to 2019 production/sales targets.
Has anyone seen one or know an owner? Cant find anything on youtube.
That's bc youtube is banned in China
"You can view it on the Nio App. I can't say I would run out and buy, but I am not the target market. "
"It looks cool, but the smoke element doesn't make any sense. Afterall, EVs don't put out exhaust fumes and the only time you do see smoke coming from an EV is in the rare event that one catches fire..."

Thanks Ricky! is it just a massive windshield washer receptacle and a cover over the front drive motor?
Pretty much.

Thank you for sharing!
"Appreciate time stamping the video where NIO comes in, especially in this 8 hour event for various other speakers.

I also found it very interesting there are 170,000 active users on the NIO phone app, but only ~8,000 vehicles on the road."
"It's refreshing to see NIO execute its plans and meet their goals, especially compared to some of other start ups like Faraday Future."
About a 100% increase from October

I want one! I hope the stock falls lot more so I can get lot of those to one day pay for the car. Ha 
Where did you find pricing?
"Nio website, but it said priority orders and im not sure if that meant the price is only for the founders edition."
"I don't see any ES6 pricing on their site, just ES8."
"Fiund an article saying it should start at 180,000 they said 50,000 to 100,000 less than es8. Is this pricing after chinas crazy incentives?"

From Padmarsee Warrior's [LinkedIn blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-doors-go-through-them-padmasree-warrior?articleId=6474038147524161536) it sounds like she is leaving on good terms. Hopefully NIO US can keep up its progress. I definitely would like to see NIO EVs arrive to the US.
No new replacements? bad news get ready for a drop tomorrow 
Already dropped .11 
Yeah that's interesting. Definitely going to have to wait to see what haplens.
"Interesting article. I feel like the Nio House is a tough concept for me to wrap my head around due to where I live. However I am hearing that they are very popular in China. Has anyone else heard anything different?  


I see the most common complaint in the article is interior fit/finish. Is that because it doesn't compare to that of an Audi or Mercedes? At less than half the cost, is that a valid complaint or just nitpicking? That would be a somewhat easy item to remedy.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any details on the ET7, other than it being a sedan?

&#x200B;

I'm very excited for Nio, not just as an investment, but also as a possible purchase should they decide to enter the Canadian market someday in the future. "
Never heard of ET7
"Yes, there is very vague info but it looks to be their next release. I would be far more excited for a truck than a car. Our major manufacturers are starting to dump their car lines and with a truck next they could beat Tesla to market."
"Yeah, I was surprised how the es6 was barely mentioned in the subreddit. Especially considering that the car could make nio a more worthy tesla competitor."
I think so too. The model 3 is a great car but it is still very expensive by most peoples standards. Es6 is a cuv which are far more popular (at least here in Canada) and the price point is excellent. Might be time to expand my position.
"Yeah, This car could get nio into the american market."
Don't try to promote your video here.
"Very impressive quarter, much like Tesla's Q3 big swings in Revenue and margins. "
Ramp doesn't look good. October numbers very similar to September ones.
I believe china had a big holiday or something like that that lowered production in October.
NIO looks much nicer.  Exterior and interior
Like Tesla‚Äôs interior better but the look of nio suv
Should have used the white interior in the X
Going strong
Bought my first Nio shares today :)
Sit on it tariffs should change soon + China is going to get funding from their banks soon so should help out the economy in China and Nio as a stock
"I think for anyone that feels they missed out on Tesla this is their chance to redeem themselves.  

We are talking China 60% EV market. 

Huge!!! Huge!!!!

I hope it stays low so I can get a nice pile of shares to sit on. "
Thx. Down the road I‚Äôm hoping to use my crypto funds as way to buy more nio.
Yeah i got 21 shares for 12$. :(. But this company have a chance to get big. So worth it long term. 
"Omg I just noticed the post above mine. Lol I am hoping my crypto‚Äôs will allow me to buy more nio!  

I am banking on this one XYO.  It‚Äôs going to be on binance before the end of the year they said.  "
Thx I‚Äôll check it out!
I personally think Nio will do great. It will do great once the ‚Äútrade war‚Äù is over in my estimate. Only reason the decline started was because of the tariffs place I personally think now is the best time to jump in!
It‚Äôs early to tell but I think that it has great potential and it could do extremely well. That being said they have a lot of improvements to make not to mention we don‚Äôt know how long these cars will last if batteries fail (catch fire) or electrical problems start to happen it‚Äôs all over
Yup. I strongly believe Nio will be a great stock. Company has real potential.

"In at 8.25, if it continues dropping, I'm buying more. Long-haul for sure. 2020 US model will be a good surge, imo."
Great insight
"https://youtu.be/x4qYjqC7eVQ

Yeah im getting confident with Nio after surfing alot of stuff"
"Hey, jin022, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

Good bot.
Any and all competitors are trying to wipe them out before they explode.
What will their growth be determined by? Mostly cars sold in the Chinese market right?

Within the first two days the price more than doubled which was awesome. The only reason that it fell to $9 and is sitting around there is because of the tariffs. I definitely think once the whole ‚ÄúTrade War‚Äù is over this stock will jump. The whole goal of them joining the NYSE was to get enough money to distribute to widen their distribution.
10% is not exactly cratering....
Give it time! That was just the initial pump of an IPO.  
What about 12%?
Definitely going well so far... About 2x from IPO price.
"Just threw down for some shares.
Hopefully with tarrif lifts and the adoption of these cars they will be a nice bag to hold."
Are you guys planning on holding or are you going to buy some more shares? 
I'm going to buy today. I believe the es8 has a lot of potential.
"I'm concerned that while they are already delivering and nicely ramping, the pre-orders are still quite low. Does anyone have insight on that? How much hype is there? Any reviews from first customers?"
I brought yesterday and making some good money 
"Bought alot and planning to go long. Lemme share this article why it's hyped

I honestly think buy more. I'm definitely watching the price to see what happens today.
"Yeah, I just bought. The fa t that they already have a car in production and in the hands of customers is very promising. Compared to all the others ( Faraday Future, Byton, Lucid etc)"
"Do some research into the founder of the company, the locations of their manufacturing and the investments they‚Äôve received. A company such as this is *needs* to exist and thrive, especially in America to compete against Tesla. I like the looks of it. "
I know i say a few reviews from China. Check out youtube

My order went through at 6.62 this morning. I'm happy. The company looks promising. The only fear I have is that their extensively repeated target of 2020 for autonomous driving might be to tight. However the es8 and ep9 already prove this company is capable.
Good close! We are amongst the lucky ones!
"Yeah, going with an experienced Chinese manufacturer and starting in the Chinese market is a very smart strategy. Much faster than Tesla's, who pay the price of innovation (and reap the rewards though)."
